<phrase>ok</phrase> , this <phrase>movie</phrase> was cool . i do n't think it was the best <phrase>movie</phrase> ever made but it sure was fun . my brother and i still <phrase>act</phrase> out scenes once in a while , and will occasionally yank the <phrase>movie</phrase> out of the cupboard , blow off the dust and <phrase>pop</phrase> it in . enjoyable all the way until the end , but a great concept . this is a <phrase>movie</phrase> that one has to just forget criticism all together and just enjoy . judgment is victory for <phrase>robot</phrase> jox .
i so wanted to believe in this <phrase>movie</phrase> after the only form of mainstream <phrase>comedy</phrase> this <phrase>country</phrase> recognises is <phrase>slapstick</phrase> and <phrase>stereotypes</phrase> . of course , it went completely the other way - let 's be cool and edgy - and came out the other side with little to show for it . i <phrase>bet</phrase> one small <phrase>seed</phrase> went nuts for this . i know <phrase>sl</phrase> did . none of the main characters have the comedic chops to pull it off . even danny k had better timing . i 'm actually being serious . every time they introduced a <phrase>bit</phrase> character i kept thinking , <phrase>``</phrase> darn , this person should have been the <phrase>lead</phrase> ! '' . <phrase>independent</phrase> does n't mean that the <phrase>camera</phrase> work needs to be horrible . <phrase>black</phrase> and <phrase>white</phrase> did nothing for this <phrase>movie</phrase> - actually with such flat dialogue it hurt this even more by bringing the boredom into sharp <phrase>relief</phrase> . the <phrase>black</phrase> and <phrase>white</phrase> also was n't crisp . the composition was horrible . the use of <phrase>music</phrase> was horrible . strangely enough i watched little miss sunshine after this <phrase>movie</phrase> and the composition on that was superb - maybe that 's why the deficiencies in this <phrase>movie</phrase> stick out in my mind . i think corne ( who was funnier than the leads before he even said anything ) was speaking to this <phrase>movie</phrase> and not <phrase>david</phrase> - see it and you 'll understand . i <phrase>bet</phrase> the guys who organise <phrase>oppikoppi</phrase> were dismayed . one would think nothing happens there at all . i got the feeling it could have been filmed in someone 's back <phrase>garden</phrase> . i know regular guys who have much funnier , raunchier and wittier conversations than any of these <phrase>``</phrase> <phrase>comics</phrase> '' . the dude who they hooked up with end was <phrase>ok</phrase> though . guess sa <phrase>comedy</phrase> 's <phrase>gon na</phrase> stay in the <phrase>stone age</phrase> a little longer . <phrase>nice</phrase> work guys .
seriously , i 'm all for gooey <phrase>romantic</phrase> comedies and will get sucked into miss congeniality as easily as <phrase>goodfellas</phrase> ... but this <phrase>movie</phrase> ? it does n't make any sense ! ! ! ! and i 'm not even talking about the willing <phrase>suspension of disbelief</phrase> kind of not making sense . why does her <phrase>family</phrase> <phrase>live</phrase> in <phrase>england</phrase> ? or , at the very least , why does n't she have a <phrase>british</phrase> accent ? she 's sure cozy with her dad and he 's surprisingly forgiving of her not being around for the last two years . ( on that subject , no one ever makes much of a deal about her being away for so <phrase>long</phrase> ) . and what was with the <phrase>goofy</phrase> outfits at the <phrase>bachelorette party</phrase> ? i 'm not even going to get into the fact that the <phrase>escort</phrase> she paid for <phrase>falls</phrase> in <phrase>love</phrase> with her -- that could 've been overcome by better <phrase>movie</phrase>-making . i 'm just saying that the characters , the setting , and the plot are n't fleshed out enough to make an even somewhat cohesive story . oh , and the worst part , in my opinion , is the <phrase>filmmaker</phrase> 's consistent use of the most unflattering angles on deborah messing 's nose -- i 'd have sued the filmmakers if i were her ! i mean , honestly , i 'm all for women being who they are , but why , in seven loyal years of will and grace viewing , have i not ever noticed how incredibly odd her nose is ? oh ! because those producers are kind to her ! this <phrase>movie</phrase> , like my other least favorite <phrase>movie</phrase> ever , <phrase>armageddon</phrase> , is the fault of the filmmakers , not the <phrase>actors</phrase> . i can see both messing and mcdermott in these roles with a better <phrase>writer</phrase> , <phrase>director</phrase> , and <phrase>producer</phrase> . this easily gets my vote as one of the worst movies i 've ever wasted time on . i 'm just glad a friend loaned me her <phrase>dvd</phrase> , so all i wasted was time . if there were a way to make this review zero <phrase>stars</phrase> , i 'd do it .
` stanley and iris ' is a <phrase>heart</phrase> warming <phrase>film</phrase> about two people who find each other and help one another overcome their problems in <phrase>life</phrase> . stanley 's <phrase>life</phrase> is difficult , because he never learned to read or write . iris is a widower with two teenage children working in a <phrase>bakery</phrase> where she meets stanley . she decides to teach stanley how to read at her home in her spare time . over time they become romantically involved . after stanley learns to read , he goes off to a good job in <phrase>chicago</phrase> , only to return to iris and ask her to marry him . it 's a really good <phrase>film</phrase> without <phrase>nudity</phrase> , <phrase>violence</phrase> , or <phrase>profanity</phrase> , that which is rare in today 's <phrase>films</phrase> . a good <phrase>film</phrase> all round .
sometimes a <phrase>film</phrase> comes along that is unique . the <phrase>nostril</phrase> picker is one such <phrase>film</phrase> , the <phrase>nostril</phrase> picker is like no other <phrase>film</phrase> i have ever seen , unfortunately for the <phrase>nostril</phrase> picker & myself it 's unique for different reasons than what the filmmakers had <phrase>originally intended</phrase> . read on & all shall hopefully become clear ... the <phrase>nostril</phrase> picker , as it 's commonly know although it was apparently filmed under the title the changer , starts with some extremely dull shots of an <phrase>american</phrase> <phrase>town</phrase> somewhere , streets & <phrase>factory</phrase> 's that sort of thing , as the <phrase>opening credits</phrase> <phrase>play</phrase> . when the <phrase>nostril</phrase> picker begins proper we , the viewer that is , are introduced to a real loser named joe <phrase>bukowski</phrase> ( carl zschering ) who is in his 40 's , he lives on his own in a crappy little <phrase>apartment</phrase> where he watches t.v. , eats <phrase>beef</phrase> flavoured <phrase>dog food</phrase> & listens to old <phrase>vinyl</phrase> records as he dances with a blow up <phrase>rubber</phrase> <phrase>sex doll</phrase> . joe likes <phrase>teenage girls</phrase> , he has various porn <phrase>magazines</phrase> but enjoys the real thing even more . however , being an ugly git joe ca n't tempt any young ladies to go out with him , or do anything else with him for that <phrase>matter</phrase> . one fateful day an old <phrase>homeless</phrase> <phrase>vietnam</phrase> vet ( <phrase>horace</phrase> <phrase>grimm</phrase> ) sees the agony & <phrase>pain</phrase> that joe has to go through ( actually he sees joe being spoken to by the cops for hassling a teenage girl ) & decides to help him out . he tells joe about an <phrase>incantation</phrase> that he learned from the 'gooks ' in <phrase>vietnam</phrase> that will transform joe 's appearance into whatever he likes . a process he calls morphosynthesis , but at the same time he warns joe that 'it makes you crazy if you do it too much ' . that night joe decides to give it a try , in a <phrase>public</phrase> place on a podium for some reason . joe says a few words , does an extremely silly <phrase>dance</phrase> & starts yodelling . joe finishes off by whistling <phrase>london bridge</phrase> is falling down , listen yeah , i <phrase>ai</phrase> n't making this up either . at first joe is visibly disappointed when nothing significant happens . to <phrase>console</phrase> himself joe tries to buy a porn mag but is shocked when the clerk ( kevin devoy ) refuses to sell it to an underage girl . joe , the bright spark that he is , realises what has happened & talks his/her way out of it by claiming his/her dad had sent him/her to buy it . joe , who now calls his <phrase>alter-ego</phrase> josephine ( ann <phrase>flood</phrase> ) , senses the possibilities & heads straight for the local <phrase>high school</phrase> . joe befriends four <phrase>teenage girls</phrase> , jennifer armstrong ( laura cummings ) , crisi stroud ( gail didia ) , tracy harper ( heidi m. gregg ) & brenda kearn ( aimee molinaro ) while under his disguise , oh & joe manages to become a pupil at the <phrase>school</phrase> simply by asking the <phrase>sports</phrase> <phrase>teacher</phrase> miss <phrase>van dyke</phrase> ( vicki hollis ) . at first joe seems harmless enough , he just likes to hang around the girls toilets & stuff like that . but things soon change as joe brutally murders brenda . jennifer 's dad , vince armstrong ( edward tanner ) is a <phrase>detective</phrase> so along with his partner ed simpson ( <phrase>clyde</phrase> surrell ) & <phrase>walt</phrase> spencer ( bruce alden ) the <phrase>pathologist</phrase> is determined to catch the <phrase>sicko</phrase> responsible for killing his daughter 's <phrase>friends</phrase> , but will they succeed before joe strikes again ? the <phrase>imdb</phrase> listing for the <phrase>nostril</phrase> picker is wrong , i watched it mere hours ago & it clearly states that it 's <phrase>directed</phrase> by mark nowicki who was also a co-<phrase>producer</phrase> & definitely not patrick j. matthews who was credited as a co-<phrase>producer</phrase> & the <phrase>cinematographer</phrase> , not that it makes much difference & i 'd have though that nowicki would have been more than happy for matthews to take the 'credit ' for making this piece of crap . no one involved in the making of the <phrase>nostril</phrase> picker should be allowed to go anywhere near a <phrase>camera</phrase> again , ever . the <phrase>nostril</phrase> picker is easily one of the worst <phrase>films</phrase> i 've ever seen , & that 's saying something . it 's <phrase>absolutely terrible</phrase> in every possible way imaginable . the script by steven hodge is atrocious , there 's no <phrase>narrative</phrase> structure , excitement , tension , <phrase>drama</phrase> , <phrase>character development</phrase> & the things that do happen are so <phrase>mind numbingly</phrase> dumb it 's untrue . the <phrase>plot devices</phrase> & chain of events in the <phrase>nostril</phrase> picker are totally incomprehensible . the scene where joe finds out the <phrase>prostitute</phrase> ( steven andrews ) he hired is in fact a man & joe starts to chase him around his <phrase>apartment</phrase> with two squirting <phrase>dildo</phrase> 's is simply <phrase>jaw dropping</phrase> stuff . the subsequent scene when the <phrase>transvestite</phrase> reports the incident to the <phrase>police</phrase> is hilariously written & had me psychically laughing at the dialogue . i hated the ending as well , not only was it predictable but it <phrase>leaves</phrase> the door open for a <phrase>sequel</phrase> , i psychically shudder at the mere thought ! on a technical level the <phrase>nostril</phrase> picker is awful , point & hope <phrase>photography</phrase> , bland & inappropriate <phrase>music</phrase> , forgettable locations , <phrase>poorly edited</phrase> ( brenda is killed in the kitchen yet her <phrase>blood</phrase> splashes on the t.v . screen that was clearly in the opposite room ) , some of the worst acting i 've <phrase>sat</phrase> through & very unimpressive <phrase>special effects</phrase> which consist of a few cut off <phrase>rubber</phrase> fingers , a slit throat & a quick scene where joe eats some flesh . it comes as no surprise that the cast & crew who worked on the <phrase>nostril</phrase> picker have virtually no <phrase>imdb</phrase> credits for anything before or after . even at 76 <phrase>odd minutes</phrase> the <phrase>nostril</phrase> picker is far to <phrase>long</phrase> & really boring to sit through . i could go on & on all day <phrase>long</phrase> about how bad the <phrase>nostril</phrase> picker is , i really could . one thing i ca n't quite work out is was all this intentional by the filmmakers ? the <phrase>nostril</phrase> picker is indeed a unique <phrase>film</phrase> , unique in it 's awfulness & incompetence . in the the case of the <phrase>nostril</phrase> picker i hope it remains unique too , having said that it 's still not the worst <phrase>film</phrase> i 've ever seen but it comes close that 's for sure . definitely one to avoid .
every great <phrase>gangster</phrase> <phrase>movie</phrase> has under-currents of <phrase>human drama</phrase> . do n't expect an emotional story of guilt , retribution and despair from <phrase>``</phrase> scarface '' . this is a <phrase>tale</phrase> of ferocious greed , <phrase>corruption</phrase> , and power . the darker side of the fabled <phrase>``</phrase> <phrase>american</phrase> dream '' . anybody complaining about the <phrase>``</phrase> cheesiness '' of this <phrase>film</phrase> is missing the point . the superficial characters , cheesy <phrase>music</phrase> , and dated fashions further <phrase>fuel</phrase> the criticism of this <phrase>life</phrase> of diabolical excess . nothing in the lives of these characters really <phrase>matter</phrase> , not on any <phrase>human</phrase> level at least . in fact the <phrase>film</phrase> practically borderlines <phrase>satire</phrase> , ironic considering all the <phrase>gangsta</phrase> rappers that were positively inspired by the lifestyle of <phrase>tony montana</phrase> . this is n't brian depalma 's strongest directorial effort , it is occasionally excellent and well-handled ( particularly the memorable finale ) , but frequently sinks to sloppy and misled . thankfully , it is supported by a very strong script by <phrase>oliver stone</phrase> ( probably good therapy for him , considering the coke habit he was tackling at the time ) . the themes are consistent , with the focus primarily on the <phrase>life</phrase> of <phrase>tony montana</phrase> , and the <phrase>evolution</phrase> of his character as he is consumed by greed and power . the dialogue is also excellent , see-sawing comfortably between humour and <phrase>drama</phrase> . there are many stand-out lines , which have since wormed their way into <phrase>popular culture</phrase> in one form or another . the cast help make it what it is as well , but this is really pacino 's <phrase>film</phrase> . one of his earlier less subtle performances ( something much more common from him nowadays ) , this is a world entirely separate from <phrase>michael corleone</phrase> and <phrase>frank serpico</phrase> . yet he is as watchable here as ever , in very entertaining ( and intentionally over-the-top ) form . it is hard to imagine another <phrase>tony montana</phrase> after seeing this <phrase>film</phrase> , in possibly one of the most mimicked performances ever . <phrase>pfeiffer</phrase> stood out as dull and uncomfortable on first viewing , but i 've come to realize how she plays out the part of the bored little wife . not an exceptional effort , but unfairly misjudged . the <phrase>supporting players</phrase> are very good too , particularly paul shenar as the suave alejandro <phrase>sosa</phrase> . powerful , occasionally humorous , sometimes shocking , and continually controversial . <phrase>``</phrase> scarface '' is one of the <phrase>films</phrase> of the eighties ( whatever that might mean to you ) . an essential and accessible <phrase>gangster</phrase> flick , and a <phrase>pop-culture</phrase> landmark . 9/10
it takes a <phrase>serbian</phrase> or at least a <phrase>balkan</phrase> familiarity to understand and enjoy many of the situations , characters and jokes of 'zavet ' as well as of many other <phrase>films</phrase> of kusturica . see for example the opening scenes , with the remote <phrase>village</phrase> in the <phrase>serbian</phrase> <phrase>mountains</phrase> , with the low-tech devices that defend the integrity and way of <phrase>life</phrase> of the inhabitants , the <phrase>nostalgia</phrase> for the good days of the <phrase>communist</phrase> rule , and the awakening of the young brat watching his nude <phrase>teacher</phrase> at the sounds of the <phrase>soviet</phrase> <phrase>hymn</phrase> . kusturica not only tries to depart from the tragic <phrase>history</phrase> of <phrase>serbia</phrase> described in his previous movies , but creates a whole world of himself in the process . this is not a <phrase>political</phrase> <phrase>film</phrase> or not an explicit <phrase>political</phrase> <phrase>film</phrase> in any case . it 's a fun <phrase>film</phrase> before all . kusturica creates a set of characters that we care about . <phrase>music</phrase> plays an active role in this <phrase>film</phrase> same as in all his other movies . his style is direct and <phrase>grotesque</phrase> , we now what he feels about his characters and we know that he wants us to feel the same . the space he develops melds present , <phrase>history</phrase> and magic , and the colours seem to be of a douanier <phrase>rousseau</phrase> of modern cinema . this is not a perfect <phrase>film</phrase> either . the principal flaw is the length , some <phrase>editing</phrase> and shortening would have been useful , as at some point in time the <phrase>director</phrase> seems to have run out of ideas and repetitions show up . it is yet one of the most catching , amusing , moving <phrase>films</phrase> that i have seen lately .
i have been a fan of this <phrase>movie</phrase> for years and years . because of teri hatchers move into the forefront , i had to take the <phrase>movie</phrase> off the shelf and <phrase>watch</phrase> it . why people back in 1991 did not see how wonderful this <phrase>movie</phrase> was in beyond me ? <phrase>sally field</phrase> and <phrase>kevin kline</phrase> are beyond fabulous . although i never have watching daytime <phrase>soap operas</phrase> , this <phrase>movie</phrase> kills me every time i <phrase>watch</phrase> it . the acting is second to none for a <phrase>comedy</phrase> and the writing is so smart . i <phrase>highly recommend</phrase> that you <phrase>watch</phrase> this if you have n't already . you will get to see elizabeth shue , <phrase>whoopi goldberg</phrase> , <phrase>teri hatcher</phrase> , and <phrase>carrie fisher</phrase> ... to name a few ... all give splendid performances .
this is one of the most interesting movies i have ever seen . i <phrase>love</phrase> the backwoods feel of this <phrase>movie</phrase> . the <phrase>movie</phrase> is very realistic and believable . this seems to take place in another <phrase>era</phrase> , maybe the late 60 's or early 70 's . <phrase>henry thomas</phrase> works well with the young baby . very moving story and worth a look .
i chuckled a few times during this <phrase>movie</phrase> . i laughed out loud during the notarizing of the <phrase>margarine</phrase> <phrase>company</phrase> handover ( <phrase>pun</phrase> intended ) . there are three segments in this <phrase>movie</phrase> . the first one is supposed to be a spoof of <phrase>``</phrase> woman 'grows up ' and launches career '' movies . the <phrase>tampax</phrase>® box was the funniest thing in this segment . most of the <phrase>cast members</phrase> are n't <phrase>listed</phrase> here on <phrase>imdb</phrase> . they are the lucky ones . few other people will be able to connect this thing to the ruin of their acting careers . the second segment is a spoof of <phrase>``</phrase> sharkish woman sleeps her way to the top and seizes control of huge <phrase>industry</phrase> '' movies . <phrase>robert culp</phrase> has several funny moments , all physical humor , including the aforementioned handover . after his character dies the segment sinks <phrase>lower</phrase> and <phrase>lower</phrase> as dominique corsaire rises higher and higher . by the time she becomes first lady i wanted to rip the <phrase>cable</phrase> out of the <phrase>tv</phrase> and <phrase>watch</phrase> <phrase>``</phrase> <phrase>snow</phrase> . '' i switched to pakistani <phrase>music</phrase> videos instead . i do n't understand <phrase>urdu</phrase> , or whatever <phrase>language</phrase> the videos were in . it was still better than listening to the dialogue in this painfully dull <phrase>``</phrase> story . '' then came <phrase>``</phrase> municipalians '' with the * big * <phrase>stars</phrase> , half of them on screen for less than a minute : elisha cook , <phrase>jr</phrase>. , <phrase>christopher lloyd</phrase> , <phrase>rhea perlman</phrase> , <phrase>henny youngman</phrase> , <phrase>julie kavner</phrase> , <phrase>richard widmark</phrase> and ... * <phrase>robby benson</phrase> . * it 's supposed to be a spoof of <phrase>``</phrase> young cop teams with hardened , substance abusing older cop who needs retirement * badly * '' movies . the horizontal <phrase>flash</phrase> bar on the <phrase>police car</phrase> is very impressive . it was interesting seeing old rtd <phrase>buses</phrase> , and a shell <phrase>gas</phrase> <phrase>station</phrase> sign , and an <phrase>american</phrase> savings sign -- none of them are around anymore . nagurski 's <phrase>``</phrase> never stop anywhere you might have to get out the <phrase>car</phrase> '' made me smile momentarily . then they discuss how boring the young cop is . a lot . back and forth about how boring he is . that was as boring as this description of how boring it is . nagurski 's <phrase>law</phrase> number four , <phrase>``</phrase> never go into a <phrase>music</phrase> store that 's been cut into with an <phrase>acetylene</phrase> torch , '' made me think that the <phrase>music</phrase> store is a real <phrase>business</phrase> at the actual location the <phrase>dispatcher</phrase> gave . thinking about that was more interesting than the set-up for the gag which followed . young <phrase>falcone</phrase> ( benson ) gets <phrase>shot</phrase> . a lot . he becomes a hardened cop like nagurski . the segment keeps going . on and on . and on . it wo n't stop . it rolls relentlessly onward no <phrase>matter</phrase> how many times you wish he 'd just * die * already so this thing will end . it does n't . it goes on and on and on .... then a <phrase>``</phrase> <phrase>buffy</phrase> the <phrase>vampire</phrase> <phrase>slayer</phrase> '' episode which i 've seen four times already comes on . thank <phrase>god</phrase> ! this abysmal <phrase>movie</phrase> ended while i went to get the <phrase>mail</phrase> .
<phrase>lost</phrase> is largely considered one of the most beautiful <phrase>tv</phrase> series that have never done ... and so is ... if you lovers of mysteries , intrigue and <phrase>adventure</phrase> this is the series for you ... in the first <phrase>season</phrase> ... since the first episode starts to go increasingly to move <phrase>forward</phrase> until you get to the second <phrase>season</phrase> ... in the second you lose a little its <phrase>cocktail</phrase> of <phrase>mystery</phrase> and expectation and pushes very on and reveal the various mysteries that the <phrase>island</phrase> hides ... the third <phrase>season</phrase> is perhaps the second most beautiful because resumed suffered since the first episode with the pace and tenacity of the first <phrase>season</phrase> ... the fourth also not let <phrase>pass</phrase> unnoticed and tends to reveal a little mysteries ... but not as the second <phrase>season</phrase> but at a somewhat different ... for the fifth <phrase>season</phrase> expects ...
probably my all-time favorite <phrase>movie</phrase> , a story of selflessness , sacrifice and dedication to a noble cause , but it 's not preachy or boring . it just never gets old , despite my having seen it some 15 or more times in the last 25 years . <phrase>paul lukas</phrase> ' performance brings tears to my eyes , and <phrase>bette davis</phrase> , in one of her very few truly sympathetic roles , is a delight . the kids are , as grandma says , more like <phrase>``</phrase> dressed-up midgets '' than children , but that only makes them more fun to <phrase>watch</phrase> . and the mother 's slow awakening to what 's happening in the world and under her own roof is believable and startling . if i had a dozen thumbs , they 'd all be <phrase>``</phrase> up '' for this <phrase>movie</phrase> .
i just came back from <phrase>``</phrase> el otro '' playing here in <phrase>buenos aires</phrase> and i have to say i was very disappointed . the <phrase>film</phrase> is very <phrase>slow moving</phrase> ( do n't get me wrong , i enjoy <phrase>slow moving</phrase> <phrase>films</phrase> ! ) , slow to the point of driving you crazy . all you hear is julio chavez breathing heavily throughout the whole <phrase>film</phrase> . this is a poorly made <phrase>film</phrase> , but more importantly , it is a <phrase>film</phrase> without a lick of inspiration , i felt nothing for the story or its characters . <phrase>``</phrase> el otro '' was made only for the <phrase>sake</phrase> of making a <phrase>film</phrase> ... making it forgetful . i would advise you to <phrase>pass</phrase> on this one , if you want to see good <phrase>argentinian</phrase> <phrase>films</phrase> , look for <phrase>films</phrase> by sorin .
i grew up on this classic <phrase>western</phrase> series , and as a child always considered it a treat being allowed to stay up late on sunday evenings to <phrase>watch</phrase> it . <phrase>bonanza</phrase> is still infinitely re watchable in re <phrase>runs</phrase> . the series chronicles the adventures of the cartwright <phrase>family</phrase> , who <phrase>live</phrase> on a <phrase>ranch</phrase> near <phrase>virginia city</phrase> , <phrase>nevada</phrase> around the <phrase>civil war era</phrase> . their <phrase>ranch</phrase> ( called the ponderosa ) is run and defended by the widowed father , ben , and his unmarried three sons , <phrase>adam</phrase> , hoss , and little joe . these three brothers have different mothers , all of whom have passed away <phrase>years earlier</phrase> . the cartwrights are a <phrase>hard working</phrase> , prosperous , and honourable <phrase>family</phrase> , highly respected in those parts . the ponderosa is large so reaching its extremities requires a lot of horseback riding . also , trips away are often necessary in <phrase>order</phrase> to buy or sell <phrase>cattle</phrase> and so forth . needless to say , few of these excursions <phrase>pass</phrase> uneventfully . although hospitable , much of the cartwrights ' <phrase>energy</phrase> must be spent defending their <phrase>ranch</phrase> from interlopers , or protecting themselves from townsfolk jealous of their prosperity and <phrase>stellar</phrase> reputation . the cartwrights do a <phrase>fair</phrase> <phrase>bit</phrase> of firing their guns up in the air and such , but only shoot to kill when deemed absolutely necessary . they are involved in various <phrase>town</phrase> affairs , even the <phrase>political</phrase> <phrase>life</phrase> of the <phrase>nevada</phrase> territory . one of the main assets of the series is the underlying warmth that is always present ( despite occasional disagreements ) between ben and his three sons , and ( despite frequent disagreements ) between the three brothers . now , one brother might beat up another every now and then , but generally has a good reason for it at the time and his anger never lasts <phrase>long</phrase> ! the characters are all very well drawn . ben is portrayed as a successful and noble man of great integrity . the oldest son , <phrase>adam</phrase> , the most rational and suave of the brothers , left midway through the series . the middle brother , hoss , is a <phrase>gentle giant</phrase> of a <phrase>teddy bear</phrase> , who has an insatiable appetite for <phrase>food</phrase> and is a little shy around the ladies . the youngest , little joe , is a hot headed , handsome charmer who , by contrast , has quite a way with women . this trio of brothers enjoy various romances but their <phrase>love</phrase> interests are typically killed off by the end of the episode or else <phrase>marriage</phrase> proves impossible , for whatever reason . the <phrase>actors</phrase> are all <phrase>stellar</phrase> in their roles , including <phrase>pernell roberts</phrase> ( <phrase>adam</phrase> ) , <phrase>dan blocker</phrase> ( hoss ) , <phrase>michael landon</phrase> ( little joe ) , and of course <phrase>lorne greene</phrase> as the principled <phrase>family</phrase> <phrase>patriarch</phrase> , ben . i also <phrase>love</phrase> the <phrase>ranch</phrase> cook , hop sing , played by <phrase>victor sen yung</phrase> . this is a wonderful <phrase>action</phrase> packed <phrase>western</phrase> with great values . the cartwrights are always the noble heroes and most of the <phrase>bad guys</phrase> quite villainous . if only there were more programs like this vintage <phrase>western</phrase> on <phrase>tv</phrase> these days !
tenants two writers struggle to complete their books in an all but empty <phrase>apartment</phrase> <phrase>house</phrase> . they at first help each other and then slowly the tension between them begins to build . this is based upon a <phrase>bernard malamud</phrase> novel and unfortunately everyone speaks as though they are in that novel . very little of the dialog is natural , its purple and brimming with shades of meaning . its as if a <phrase>college</phrase> <phrase>english</phrase> <phrase>major</phrase> with a head full of pretensions wrote the script . it 's awful and i found myself instantly <phrase>immune</phrase> to anything the <phrase>film</phrase> had to say , which is a shame since the <phrase>film</phrase> is populated with <phrase>great performances</phrase> from top to bottom . <phrase>snoop</phrase> <phrase>dog</phrase> on down are fine form , unfortunately none of them can over come the falseness of the words and the premise . i ca n't really recommend this <phrase>movie</phrase> . while not really bad , its very preachy and pretentious to the point of making you want to walk away . i <phrase>lost</phrase> interest less then a third of the way in and had to struggle to get to the end . if you 're interested i 'd try it on <phrase>cable</phrase> , but i would n't lay out good <phrase>money</phrase> to see it .
this reminds me of when i was a born-again believer who was going to be a <phrase>minister</phrase> . i never actually thought i would be a <phrase>minister</phrase> or even graduate from <phrase>high school</phrase> because i was almost positive i would be raptured to <phrase>heaven</phrase> before that would ever happen . that was before i discovered that <phrase>christianity</phrase> was a bunch rubbish . i am now an <phrase>atheist</phrase> , and that just proves that the <phrase>``</phrase> once saved always saved '' doctorine that <phrase>christians</phrase> tell us is no more real than elves . if it were true then why did i leave after many years of being a devout born again believer ? yes , i really was saved . i prayed that silly sinners <phrase>prayer</phrase> with all my <phrase>heart</phrase> . if <phrase>christians</phrase> were to read their <phrase>bible</phrase> they would discover that their <phrase>god</phrase> thinks like <phrase>rape</phrase> , <phrase>genocide</phrase> , <phrase>abortion</phrase> , and many other atrocities are alright according to him . they might be surprised to learn that no where is the word <phrase>``</phrase> <phrase>rapture</phrase> '' mentioned .
ah , bait . how do i hate thee ? let me <phrase>count</phrase> the ways . 1 . you try to be funny , but are corny and unenjoyable ; every joke is predictable and expected , and when it comes , does not inspire laughter . instead , i want to hurl . 2 . you try to be dramatic , but are unbelievable ; the woman overacts to a terrible <phrase>degree</phrase> , and the <phrase>``</phrase> <phrase>bad guy</phrase> '' looks like bill gates , and is about as scary as ... well , bill gates . ( just try to imagine bill gates trying to intimidate somebody with a gun . does n't work , does it ? a <phrase>lawyer</phrase> , maybe , but not a gun . does n't fit . ) as for <phrase>jamie foxx</phrase> , well , just watching him try to deliver a dramatic and heartfelt dialogue is ludicrous , and makes me want to hurl . 3 . you try to be <phrase>action</phrase>-packed , but instead are dull and dragging too many times . and when the <phrase>action</phrase> heats up , the <phrase>tripod</phrase> for the <phrase>camera</phrase> must have been <phrase>lost</phrase> , for the scenes wobble more than those in the <phrase>blair</phrase> <phrase>witch</phrase> project , and i find myself nauseated , and once again i want to hurl . 4 . you try to be a good <phrase>movie</phrase> , but you failed , you failed , you failed ! i would rather walk barefoot across the <phrase>sahara</phrase> with a pack full of <phrase>beef</phrase> jerky and no <phrase>water</phrase> , no <phrase>sunscreen</phrase> , and only <phrase>meryl streep</phrase> for <phrase>company</phrase> . this hell would be lovelier than a <phrase>single</phrase> minute more spent watching everyone in bait overact their way through an idiotically written story with bill gates for a <phrase>bad guy</phrase> , and let 's not even <phrase>talk</phrase> about the massive bomb that goes off in a <phrase>car</phrase> that <phrase>jamie foxx</phrase> 's character has just driven off a cliff , but somehow manages to escape ... just kill me now , or do the right thing and promise me that somehow i 'll never have to <phrase>watch</phrase> a <phrase>movie</phrase> that is this bad , ever again .
<phrase>oscar</phrase>-<phrase>caliber</phrase> performance by <phrase>peter falk</phrase> in an <phrase>oscar</phrase>-<phrase>caliber</phrase>-written role . i loved the nuanced , balanced exploration of a <phrase>long</phrase>-time <phrase>marriage</phrase> - how often do we get that in <phrase>films</phrase> , where usually the <phrase>movie</phrase> ends when boy & girl get together ? this is a <phrase>movie</phrase> for adults , a complex view through the eyes of all <phrase>parties</phrase> - husband , wife , son - how each have adapted to each other in the past and grow during the story . on top of that , it gave me about 10 <phrase>major</phrase> <phrase>belly laughs</phrase> , and i 'm one of those people who usually sits unamused when the rest of an audience is laughing . this was one of the few truly funny movies i 've seen . great , original jokes .
pieced ( edited ) together from <phrase>dead body</phrase> parts ( <phrase>deleted scenes</phrase> ) from corpses ( <phrase>anchorman</phrase> ) , the <phrase>frankenstein</phrase> monster ( wake up , <phrase>ron burgundy</phrase> ) is definitely not a sight for sore eyes ( something you 'd ever want to <phrase>watch</phrase> twice ..... maybe even once for that <phrase>matter</phrase> . ) more often than not -the <phrase>relativity</phrase> of the scenes in wurb are made relevant by a third person narrator . even more troubling is that the characters in wurb are inconsistent with the versions of themselves that we had at the end of <phrase>anchorman</phrase> ( in opening narration we 're told wurb <phrase>takes place</phrase> shortly after the original . ) at the end of <phrase>anchorman</phrase> , <phrase>burgundy</phrase> had grown since the start of the <phrase>film</phrase> and embraced having a <phrase>hybrid</phrase> co-anchorwoman/lover . in this <phrase>film</phrase> , he 's back to his immature antics with prank <phrase>phone calls</phrase> to veronica ( quite clearly these are the more of the same scenes from the original <phrase>anchorman</phrase> spliced in to wurb . ) the part that makes this a <phrase>movie</phrase> , a continually evolving story , involves a <phrase>bank</phrase>-robbing <phrase>clan</phrase> without a cause called the <phrase>alarm clock</phrase> . these scenes are almost painful to sit through . this part was scrapped from the original scripts for <phrase>anchorman</phrase> . the majority of other scenes involving our <phrase>channel</phrase> 4 <phrase>news</phrase> team are clearly alternate/deleted takes on scenes from <phrase>anchorman</phrase> . they go to the same <phrase>party</phrase> as in the original , the same original <phrase>``</phrase> group bitching about having a woman on the team '' scene , and the same <phrase>cat</phrase> <phrase>fashion</phrase> show segment that veronica had objections to reporting . <phrase>burgundy</phrase> re-creates their first date with the drive-in spot overlooking <phrase>san diego</phrase> and dinner at his favorite club , <phrase>tinos</phrase> . neither character make mention that they 've been to the drive-in spot before and when <phrase>burgundy</phrase> <phrase>walks</phrase> into <phrase>tinos</phrase> with veronica , he introduces it to her as though they 've never been before . oh , and they 're wearing the same clothes as on their original date . still , i have to give some credit to the filmmakers - even if wurb is nothing more than a clever way of presenting <phrase>deleted scenes</phrase> tied together with narration . between the two <phrase>ron burgundy</phrase> stories - this is the weaker one . looking back on it , it 's quite a feat for <phrase>anchorman</phrase> to have risen from the ashes of wurb . you stay classy , <phrase>imdb</phrase> . thanks for stopping by .
let me start off by saying that this does n't seem or feel like a <phrase>movie</phrase> . it seems like just another <phrase>tv</phrase> show about popular girls and boys with no real <phrase>film</phrase> <phrase>language</phrase> top back it up . the <phrase>camera</phrase> angles are so <phrase>straight forward</phrase> that the story is told the simplest way possible never making the <phrase>public</phrase> connect with it . this <phrase>film</phrase> takes us to where no <phrase>movie</phrase> i 've seen has done before : to a realm where the <phrase>film</phrase> <phrase>theater</phrase> becomes a warm medium giving the <phrase>public</phrase> every element of interpretation . too obvious . the large <phrase>movie</phrase> screen is only used as an enlarged <phrase>tv</phrase> from where we can see every attribute of these women in a <phrase>larger than life</phrase> manner . lately it seems that young <phrase>directors</phrase> are compromising the <phrase>art</phrase> of <phrase>film</phrase> making for sales . this is very scary . the <phrase>industry</phrase> is spoiling the <phrase>art</phrase> in movies . we must educate ourselves and our children about what <phrase>cinematography</phrase> and its <phrase>language</phrase> are really about . not just sales and <phrase>entertainment</phrase> , but a way to communicate feelings , <phrase>passions</phrase> and even <phrase>culture</phrase> . not as a launching platform for <phrase>young divas</phrase> and jocks .
well , what can you say about <phrase>sitcoms</phrase> . there often quite lame , <phrase>morale</phrase> dedicative , and just plain . so is this show ! it got a boring cast , although a.bynes is okej in her perky way , the rest is just stereotypical crap .... as always . we have all seen it before , and will probably see it all over again when this show is cancelled . cause , lets face it , its a mediocre and self righteous show . as the most <phrase>sitcoms</phrase> are .... well , in <phrase>short</phrase> . if you <phrase>wan na</phrase> see some good <phrase>entertainment</phrase> , you can rather take a twenty minute pause in front of the <phrase>mirror</phrase> . do some faces and move on .... its more entertaining than this show !
well , if you are one of those <phrase>katana</phrase> 's <phrase>film</phrase>-nuts ( just like me ) you sure will appreciate this <phrase>metaphysical</phrase> <phrase>katana</phrase> swinging <phrase>blood</phrase> spitting <phrase>samurai</phrase> <phrase>action</phrase> flick . starring <phrase>tadanobu asano</phrase> ( vital , barren illusion ) & ryu daisuke ( <phrase>kagemusha</phrase> ) . this <phrase>samurai</phrase> <phrase>war</phrase> between heiki 's <phrase>clan</phrase> versus <phrase>genji</phrase> 's <phrase>clan</phrase> touch the <phrase>zenith</phrase> in the <phrase>final showdown</phrase> at gojo <phrase>bridge</phrase> . the <phrase>body-count</phrase> is countless . <phrase>demons</phrase> , magic swords , <phrase>shinto</phrase> <phrase>priests</phrase> versus <phrase>buddhist</phrase> <phrase>monks</phrase> and the beautiful visions provided by maestro <phrase>sogo</phrase> ishii will do the rest . a good <phrase>japanese</phrase> flick for a rainy summer night .
there was a great <phrase>film</phrase> to be made about <phrase>steve biko</phrase> . sadly this was n't it . <phrase>denzel washington</phrase> - never the most flexible of <phrase>actors</phrase> - is totally unable to convey the great charisma that <phrase>biko</phrase> had . <phrase>attenborough</phrase> 's big crowd scenes are laughable . the <phrase>soweto</phrase> <phrase>massacre</phrase> was n't like this , three neat lines of children ( some doing cartwheels ! ) <phrase>marching</phrase> happily into the guns of the soldiers . with <phrase>biko</phrase> dead the <phrase>film</phrase> rapidly descends into <phrase>farce</phrase> . if the struggle against <phrase>apartheid</phrase> was anything it was a <phrase>black</phrase> people 's struggle yet somehow we are all supposed to be gripped by the escape of a <phrase>white</phrase> man and his <phrase>family</phrase> . i 'm sure <phrase>donald woods</phrase> was a decent man and he would be the first to say that <phrase>biko</phrase> was important while he was n't . <phrase>penelope wilton</phrase> 's accent is pure <phrase>hampshire</phrase> and she seems completely unaware that she is in <phrase>south africa</phrase> at all . at all . the <phrase>wood</phrase> 's <phrase>family</phrase> <phrase>dog</phrase> gets more lines than the <phrase>black</phrase> maid . as the <phrase>family</phrase> make their escape one the women i saw the <phrase>film</phrase> with - incidentally one of only about a dozen <phrase>black</phrase> people in a large , full cinema - whispered <phrase>``</phrase> this is like the <phrase>sound</phrase> of <phrase>music</phrase> . '' she had a point . overall this is a <phrase>film</phrase> by a well-intentioned if somewhat inept <phrase>white</phrase> <phrase>liberal</phrase> about a radical <phrase>black</phrase> people 's struggle . and really <phrase>south africa</phrase> needs well-intentioned <phrase>white</phrase> liberals like it needs a hole in the head .
this one-minute <phrase>film</phrase> is arguably the first <phrase>movie</phrase> ever made . other inventors had previously filmed actions - like <phrase>edison</phrase> 's motion <phrase>photography</phrase> of a <phrase>sneeze</phrase> - but the lumiere brothers developed equipment that tremendously advanced the medium . at the time , of course , their ` <phrase>cinematograph</phrase> ' must have bewildered their <phrase>peers</phrase> , including their subjects . in this first instance , the brothers record employees leaving their <phrase>factory</phrase> , some of whom understandably struggle to hide their awareness of the <phrase>camera</phrase> . the lumieres attempt to make the <phrase>film</phrase> more entertaining by introducing animals and a <phrase>bicycle</phrase> , but ` la <phrase>sortie</phrase> des usines lumiere ' does n't nearly match the ingenuity of their later <phrase>films</phrase> . the most interesting <phrase>aspect</phrase> of this <phrase>short film</phrase> is the brothers ' selection of a familiar <phrase>working class</phrase> <phrase>ritual</phrase> as their subject . their choice is the initial evidence of their curiosity about all of the world 's people , a quality that makes viewing their experiments immensely rewarding and fascinating today . rating : 8
a <phrase>movie</phrase> has rarely left me as cold as this one . there is not a <phrase>bit</phrase> of tension , not a second of fear , not a moment we jump , even a little <phrase>bit</phrase> . the girl is cute , yeah . that 's it . was that worth a <phrase>movie</phrase> ? i knew it was n't supposed to be a great <phrase>movie</phrase> , but i was at least expecting one .
the 1990 's begun to have day time <phrase>talk</phrase> shows sprout up left and right . every network had one , and they all lacked one thing originality . ricky <phrase>lake</phrase> was just another show to entertain the <phrase>obese</phrase> <phrase>trailer park</phrase> mother with a marlboro <phrase>cigarette</phrase> <phrase>hanging</phrase> out of her <phrase>mouth</phrase> while <phrase>breast</phrase> feeding one of her dozens of toothless , illiterate children . the <phrase>english language</phrase> and other cornerstones of mankind where ruined by this shows existence . titltes ranging from girl you a pigeon head and so on . how could anyone want to <phrase>watch</phrase> this pure and utter garbage ? has our <phrase>society</phrase> really became nothing more than a bunch of hill billy 's and dead beat fathers ? the people who appear on this show were trash . the people who watched this show were trash . anyone that wishes to see this show re aired or put onto <phrase>dvd</phrase> is trash . people wonder why <phrase>americans</phrase> are becoming huge piles of <phrase>lard</phrase> and too <phrase>fat</phrase> to even get jobs , its having shows like this tell them its <phrase>ok</phrase> to be 500lbs overweight , and have 12 year old girls <phrase>act</phrase> like <phrase>prostitutes</phrase> . having such trash on <phrase>tv</phrase> has ruined morals .
i used to <phrase>love</phrase> watching <phrase>``</phrase> sabrina , the teenage <phrase>witch</phrase> '' friday nights on <phrase>abc</phrase> 's tgif . i think this was one of the best shows on tgif . my <phrase>friends</phrase> and i used to get together every friday just to <phrase>watch</phrase> this show and we never missed an episode . my favorite character was <phrase>salem</phrase> . he was adorable and sooo funny . i liked sabrina 's boyfriend harvey , too . he was hot . i think <phrase>melissa joan hart</phrase> played a good teenage <phrase>witch</phrase> , too . my favorite episodes were <phrase>``</phrase> sabrina through the looking <phrase>glass</phrase> '' and <phrase>``</phrase> hilda and <phrase>zelda</phrase> : the teenage years '' . those episodes were great . overall i really miss this show . i hope one day <phrase>abc</phrase> brings it back with new episodes . i give this show 10/10 <phrase>stars</phrase> .
this <phrase>movie</phrase> has some things that are pretty amazing . first , it is supposed to be based on a true story . that , in itself , is amazing that multiple <phrase>tornadoes</phrase> would hit the same <phrase>town</phrase> at night in the fall-in <phrase>nebraska</phrase> . i wonder if the real <phrase>town</phrase> 's name was close to <phrase>``</phrase> blainsworth '' ( which is the <phrase>town</phrase> 's name in the <phrase>movie</phrase> ) . there is an ainsworth , <phrase>nebraska</phrase> , but there is also a <phrase>town</phrase> that starts with blains-something . it does show the slowest moving <phrase>tornadoes</phrase> on record in the the seen where the boys are in the <phrase>house</phrase> . on the other hand , the scene where the <phrase>tv</phrase> goes fuzzy is based in fact . before <phrase>doppler radar</phrase> and <phrase>weather radio</phrase> , we were taught that if you turned your <phrase>tv</phrase> to a particular <phrase>channel</phrase> ( not on <phrase>cable</phrase> ) and tuned the brightness just right , you could tell if there was a <phrase>tornado</phrase> coming . the problem was that by then you would be able to hear it . since i know something about <phrase>midwest</phrase> <phrase>tornadoes</phrase> , it made this <phrase>movie</phrase> fun for me . i enjoy it more than twister . i mean , give me a break-there is no way you could make it through and f5 by chaining yourself to a pipe in a well <phrase>house</phrase> .
for those of you who 've never heard of it ( or seen it on <phrase>a & e</phrase> ) , cracker is a brilliant <phrase>british</phrase> <phrase>tv</phrase> show about an overweight , <phrase>chain-smoking</phrase> , foulmouthed <phrase>psychologist</phrase> named fitz who helps the <phrase>manchester</phrase> <phrase>police</phrase> <phrase>department</phrase> get into the heads of violent criminals . it 's considered to be one of the finest shows ever to come out of <phrase>england</phrase> ( and that 's saying something ) , and was tremendously successful in <phrase>england</phrase> and around the world back in 1993 . now , the original <phrase>stars</phrase> have re-teamed with the original <phrase>writer</phrase> to knock out one more 2-hour episode . i 've loved this show ever since i 'd first seen it , over a decade ago . the <phrase>dvd</phrase> <phrase>box set</phrase> holds a place of honor in my collection , and i can quote a good deal of fitz 's interrogation scenes practically word for word . the idea of <phrase>robbie coltrane</phrase> reteaming with <phrase>jimmy mcgovern</phrase> for another <phrase>tv</phrase> <phrase>movie</phrase> about fitz filled me with absolute <phrase>glee</phrase> . i 'll start with the good . one of the many things that impressed me about the original cracker series was how quickly fitz was defined as a character . five minutes into the first episode  with his lecture ( throwing the books into the air ) , his drinking , and his cussing of the guy after him on the <phrase>gambling</phrase> machine queue  and you knew , simply knew , who this character was . you could feel him <phrase>``</phrase> clicking '' in your mind , the kind of click that only happens when a great <phrase>actor</phrase> gets a great role written by a great <phrase>writer</phrase> . <phrase>coltrane</phrase> , of course , remained great throughout the show , but i always felt that some of the later episodes  those not written by <phrase>mcgovern</phrase>  mistreated the character . so the good <phrase>news</phrase> is this : fitz is back . as soon as you see him in this show  making incredibly inappropriate comments at his daughter 's <phrase>wedding</phrase>  you 'll feel that <phrase>``</phrase> click '' once again . it 's him : petulant one moment and truly sorry the next , always insightful , sincere to the point of tactlessness but brilliantly funny in the process . if you <phrase>love</phrase> this character as much as i do , you 'll be delighted with how he is portrayed in the <phrase>movie</phrase> . and this extends to judith and mark : in fact , everything having to do with the fitzs is handled perfectly . the problem i do have with this <phrase>movie</phrase> revolves around the <phrase>crime</phrase> fitz is trying to solve . in standard cracker <phrase>fashion</phrase> , we know exactly who the criminal is in the first five minutes  the <phrase>suspense</phrase> lies in seeing fitz figure it out . in this case , we have a <phrase>serial killer</phrase> who is out for <phrase>american</phrase> <phrase>blood</phrase> . and the reason for this , unfortunately , is not due to any believable <phrase>psychological</phrase> trauma  rather , it seems that the murders are here simply to allow the <phrase>writer</phrase> to display his personal <phrase>political</phrase> beliefs . it 's difficult for me to write this , as i truly believe that <phrase>jimmy mcgovern</phrase> is one of the greatest writers in the world . nor do i have a problem with movies that are about current issues , or movies that take a <phrase>political</phrase> stand . but in the cracker <phrase>universe</phrase> , we expect to see the characters behaving like <phrase>human</phrase> beings , not like <phrase>caricatures</phrase> . instead , the <phrase>americans</phrase> in this <phrase>movie</phrase> are all depicted in an entirely stereotypical <phrase>fashion</phrase> . they 're know-nothing loudmouths who complain about everything , treat the locals like crap and cheat on their wives  one of them even manages to do all of the above within less than 5 minutes . i honestly thought i 'd mistakenly switched channels or something . but it does n't stop there . we get constant reminders of just how badly the <phrase>war</phrase> in <phrase>iraq</phrase> is going  reminders that have nothing whatsoever to do with the story and appear practically out of nowhere . the killer is so busy ranting about how <phrase>bush</phrase> is worse than <phrase>hitler</phrase> that he almost forgets to get on with the killing ; but more to the point , he is such a mouthpiece for the <phrase>writer</phrase> 's <phrase>political</phrase> views that he forgets to <phrase>act</phrase> like a believable <phrase>human</phrase> being , and thus we  as an audience  do n't buy his sudden transformation from a happy <phrase>family</phrase> man to a tortured serial-killing <phrase>soul</phrase> . i ca n't say that this ruined the show for me  it 's was still good <phrase>tv</phrase> , better than almost everything else in the <phrase>genre</phrase> ( mainly due to , once again , <phrase>coltrane</phrase> ) . but its constant politicizing made it impossible for it to be as good as the real cracker <phrase>classics</phrase> like <phrase>``</phrase> to be a somebody ''  an episode that was just as <phrase>``</phrase> issuey '' , but one that was handled with far more subtlety and <phrase>psychological</phrase> depth . two other small points : <phrase>panhandle</phrase> not being around is a disappointment , but what 's worse are her replacements . the entire <phrase>police</phrase> <phrase>department</phrase>  which for so <phrase>long</phrase> filled with such great characters - is now full of <phrase>vanilla</phrase> . completely interchangeable cops who lack any and all personality ( how you could drain coupling 's <phrase>richard coyle</phrase> of personality is beyond me , but it is indeed missing here ) . also , there are couple of moments where the show <phrase>lost</phrase> its believability for me . one such instance revolves around fitz having to narrow down the entire <phrase>population</phrase> of <phrase>manchester</phrase> from 1 million to a hundred based on some very strange criteria ( <phrase>french</phrase> <phrase>windows</phrase> ? how does the computer know if i have <phrase>french</phrase> <phrase>windows</phrase> ? )  he not only succeeds in doing this , but he succeeds in less than an hour . i do n't think so . so , all in all , i was a little disappointed . it 's recommended viewing , but remember to leave at least some of your expectations at the door . still , if there 's new series to come after this , it would all have been for the good : i 'm convinced that <phrase>mcgovern</phrase> can still write great stuff , and maybe now that he 's got his <phrase>politics</phrase> out of his system he can go back to writing about people .
as a <phrase>biographical film</phrase> , <phrase>``</phrase> the lady with <phrase>red</phrase> <phrase>hair</phrase> '' ( the story of how <phrase>director</phrase> /<phrase>producer</phrase>/<phrase>playwright</phrase> <phrase>david belasco</phrase> transformed notorious <phrase>society</phrase> divorcee mrs. leslie carter into an international stage <phrase>star</phrase> ) is certainly not in <phrase>a league</phrase> with that other <phrase>warner</phrase> 's <phrase>biopic</phrase> of similar vintage , <phrase>``</phrase> <phrase>yankee doodle dandy</phrase> '' ( what is ? ) , but <phrase>``</phrase> lady '' is an enjoyable <phrase>film</phrase> in its own right -- and shares quite a few traits in common with the cagney classic . like <phrase>``</phrase> <phrase>yankee doodle dandy</phrase> , '' <phrase>``</phrase> the lady with <phrase>red</phrase> <phrase>hair</phrase> '' brims over with old -time show-<phrase>business</phrase> flavor . ( among other things , both <phrase>films</phrase> feature delicious theatrical <phrase>boarding-house</phrase> sequences as well as the inevitable scenes set backstage and in theatrical managers ' offices . ) also , in <phrase>``</phrase> lady '' as in the cohan <phrase>biopic</phrase> , the <phrase>supporting cast</phrase> is made up of familiar and beloved character <phrase>actors</phrase> of the <phrase>period</phrase> , all doing the sort of top-notch work we remember them for . need i add that , again like <phrase>``</phrase> <phrase>yankee doodle dandy</phrase> , '' <phrase>``</phrase> the lady with <phrase>red</phrase> <phrase>hair</phrase> '' does n't let the truth get in the way of telling a good story ? but , also like <phrase>``</phrase> <phrase>dandy</phrase> , '' <phrase>``</phrase> lady '' does manage -- gloriously ! -- to convey the esssence of its show-<phrase>business</phrase>-giant <phrase>hero</phrase> 's <phrase>larger-than-life</phrase> personality . everyone knows that cagney limned cohan for all time in his brilliant and affectionate portrayal in <phrase>``</phrase> <phrase>yankee doodle dandy</phrase> '' -- but few moviegoers realize that <phrase>claude rains</phrase> did a similar service for <phrase>david belasco</phrase> in <phrase>``</phrase> the lady with <phrase>red</phrase> <phrase>hair</phrase> '' - -and did it with a panache that almost equals cagney 's . rains-as-<phrase>belasco</phrase> perfectly captures that legendary showman 's galvanic personality in all its outsized glory . rains gives a tremendously enjoyable , superbly observed , and remarkably true-to-<phrase>life</phrase> performance as the man all <phrase>broadway</phrase> once called <phrase>``</phrase> the wizard . '' to <phrase>watch</phrase> <phrase>claude rains</phrase> in <phrase>action</phrase> ( looking in every <phrase>shot</phrase> as if he 's having a helluva good time ! ) in <phrase>``</phrase> the lady with <phrase>red</phrase> <phrase>hair</phrase> '' is to see <phrase>david belasco</phrase> leap to <phrase>life</phrase> on <phrase>film</phrase> as if he ca n't wait to shake things up on the <phrase>main stem</phrase> once again .
one would think ( as i did ) , that with <phrase>steve martin</phrase> , <phrase>goldie</phrase> hawn , and <phrase>john cleese</phrase> , a <phrase>movie</phrase> should be , at the very least , decent . these <phrase>stars</phrase> ( especially martin and cleese ) have <phrase>produced</phrase> some of the funniest works of <phrase>comedy</phrase> of all time . well , apparently i was grossly mistaken -- this is <phrase>single</phrase>-handedly one of the worst movies i have ever seen . it boggles my mind how one joke after the other can be so profoundly unfunny . it pained me to <phrase>watch</phrase> these talented <phrase>actors</phrase> execute one of the most positively lame scripts i have had the misfortune to come across . based solely on the <phrase>big names</phrase> , i remained hopeful for a <phrase>long</phrase> time through the duration of the <phrase>film</phrase> , but it consistently failed to provide any <phrase>entertainment</phrase> whatsoever . normally , both with movies and in <phrase>life</phrase> , i try to stay away from biased comments and broad generalizations . but with this <phrase>film</phrase> , it 's hard not to let loose . i can <phrase>count</phrase> on one hand , perhaps even two or three fingers , <phrase>major</phrase> <phrase>hollywood</phrase> productions that left me more bitter than this . this is easily one of the worst comedies ever made . i tried to enjoy this -- -i really did . but the out-of-towners ultimately <phrase>fails miserably</phrase> . if you really want time-efficient <phrase>entertainment</phrase> , just take your <phrase>money</phrase> and <phrase>watch</phrase> it swirl as you flush it down the toilet . just please do n't <phrase>watch</phrase> this <phrase>movie</phrase> .
maria braun got married right in the middle of combat all around her and her husband hermann . an explosion ripped through the building , to begin with , and she and hermann had to sign the papers on a pile of <phrase>rubble</phrase> on the street . perhaps this may <phrase>strike</phrase> some as a <phrase>heavy-handed</phrase> <phrase>metaphor</phrase> for what 's about to come : <phrase>marriage</phrase> on the rocks , so to speak . it 's a betrothal where the husband goes off to <phrase>war</phrase> and is held in a <phrase>russian</phrase> <phrase>prison</phrase> camp , unbenownst to the helpless but hopeful and proud maria , who keeps standing by the depressing <phrase>rubble</phrase> of the <phrase>train station</phrase> as some come home , others do n't , with a sign awaiting hermann . trouble arises , as happens in <phrase>rainer werner fassbinder</phrase> 's <phrase>melodramas</phrase> , and as its one of his best and most provocative , we see as maria ( uncommonly gorgeous <phrase>hanna schygulla</phrase> in this role ) will do a <phrase>two-face</phrase> : she 'll stand by her man , even if it means working at a bar for <phrase>american</phrase> gi 's and , even still after she hears from a <phrase>fellow</phrase> <phrase>soldier</phrase> that hermann has died will still stand by him as she sleeps with a <phrase>black</phrase> gi and comes close to bearing his child ( that is , naturally , until he reappears and a <phrase>murder</phrase> occurs and he takes the <phrase>rap</phrase> so she can be safe ) , or working for a <phrase>german</phrase> <phrase>businessman</phrase> ( effectively sympathetic <phrase>ivan desny</phrase> ) and becoming his sometimes mistress and rising <phrase>star</phrase> in the <phrase>company</phrase> . maria will do whatever it takes to be successful , but she 'll always be married . it 's hard to say there 's anything about maria that is n't fascinating . <phrase>money</phrase> , sex , power , all of these become interchangeable for maria . she 's like the <phrase>feminist</phrase> that has her <phrase>cake</phrase> and eats it with a sultry smile : she gets to have a husband , more or less ( actually a lot less until the last ten minutes of the <phrase>film</phrase> ) while obtaining things- a man who dotes on her whenever he can , a new and expensive <phrase>house</phrase> with servants , a <phrase>secretary</phrase> , <phrase>money</phrase>- that others around her are n't getting due to already being with a man or too weak in a position to rise anywhere ( such as the <phrase>secretary</phrase> , played interestingly enough by <phrase>fassbinder</phrase> 's own mother ) . maria is sexy , confident , and all alone , with an idealized <phrase>life</phrase> going against a <phrase>life</phrase> that should be made in the shade . she says of the two men- the <phrase>american</phrase> <phrase>soldier</phrase> and poor old and sick oswald- that she 's fond of them , and at the same time will stick by those roses the confused and <phrase>soul</phrase>-searching husband hermann sends from <phrase>canada</phrase> , after being released from <phrase>prison</phrase> . she 's casts a profile that a <phrase>feminist</phrase> would <phrase>love</phrase> to trounce , but understand where she 's coming from and going all the way . <phrase>fassbinder</phrase> employs this inherent contradiction , and moments with maria appear to go against the conventions of a <phrase>melodrama</phrase> ( for example , hermann walking in on the jubilant and <phrase>half-naked</phrase> maria and gi is just about a masterpiece of a scene , with maria 's <phrase>reaction</phrase> not of surprise or guilt but pure happiness to see that he 's there let alone alive ) , while sticking to his guns as a <phrase>director</phrase> of such <phrase>high</phrase>-minded technique with a storyline that should be predictable . but it is n't really . it 's like one big <phrase>metaphor</phrase> for a <phrase>country</phrase> that , after the <phrase>war</phrase> , could n't really move on to normalcy . a few times <phrase>fassbinder</phrase> puts <phrase>sound</phrase> of the <phrase>radio</phrase> on in the background , and we see maria walking around her <phrase>family</phrase> <phrase>house</phrase> , hustle and bustle going on around her , and the <phrase>radio</phrase> speaks of a divided <phrase>germany</phrase> , of things still very unsettled , of a disarray . maybe the only way to cope is excess , or maybe that 's just my interpretation of it . it 's hard to tell , really , under schygulla 's stare face and eyes , anyway . it 's such an incredible performance , really , one of those showstoppers that captures the glamor and allure of an old-time <phrase>hollywood</phrase> female <phrase>star</phrase> while with the down-and-dirty ethic of a girl of the streets . most telling are the opposing costumes one sees in one scene when she finally is with her husband , where she <phrase>stars</phrase> in one of those super-lustful <phrase>black</phrase> <phrase>lingerie</phrase> pieces and <phrase>high</phrase> heels , and then moves on to a dress without even thinking about it . that 's almost the essence of what maria is , and schygulla wonderfully gets it down , a headstrong but somehow loving figure who is adored and perplexed by the men around her , sometimes in a <phrase>single</phrase> sentence . this is what <phrase>fassbinder</phrase> captures in his wonderful first part of his <phrase>``</phrase> <phrase>trilogy</phrase> '' ; while i might overall prefer veronika <phrase>voss</phrase> as a masterpiece , maria braun is perhaps just as good as a <phrase>character study</phrase> , of what makes a woman <phrase>tick</phrase> and tock with ( almost ) nothing to lose .
<phrase>homelessness</phrase> ( or houselessness as <phrase>george carlin</phrase> stated ) has been an issue for years but never a plan to help those on the street that were once considered <phrase>human</phrase> who did everything from going to <phrase>school</phrase> , work , or vote for the <phrase>matter</phrase> . most people think of the <phrase>homeless</phrase> as just a <phrase>lost</phrase> cause while worrying about things such as <phrase>racism</phrase> , the <phrase>war</phrase> on <phrase>iraq</phrase> , pressuring kids to succeed , <phrase>technology</phrase> , the elections , <phrase>inflation</phrase> , or worrying if they 'll be next to end up on the streets . but what if you were given a <phrase>bet</phrase> to <phrase>live</phrase> on the streets for a month without the luxuries you once had from a home , the <phrase>entertainment</phrase> sets , a bathroom , pictures on the wall , a computer , and everything you once treasure to see what it 's like to be <phrase>homeless</phrase> ? that is goddard bolt 's lesson . <phrase>mel brooks</phrase> ( who directs ) who <phrase>stars</phrase> as bolt plays a rich man who has everything in the world until deciding to make a <phrase>bet</phrase> with a sissy rival ( jeffery tambor ) to see if he can <phrase>live</phrase> in the streets for thirty days without the luxuries ; if bolt succeeds , he can do what he wants with a future project of making more buildings . the <phrase>bet</phrase> 's on where bolt is thrown on the street with a bracelet on his leg to monitor his every move where he ca n't step off the sidewalk . he 's given the <phrase>nickname</phrase> pepto by a <phrase>vagrant</phrase> after it 's written on his forehead where bolt meets other characters including a woman by the name of molly ( <phrase>lesley ann warren</phrase> ) an ex-<phrase>dancer</phrase> who got <phrase>divorce</phrase> before losing her home , and her pals <phrase>sailor</phrase> ( <phrase>howard morris</phrase> ) and fumes ( <phrase>teddy wilson</phrase> ) who are already used to the streets . they 're survivors . bolt is n't . he 's not used to reaching mutual agreements like he once did when being rich where it 's fight or flight , kill or be killed . while the <phrase>love</phrase> connection between molly and bolt was n't necessary to plot , i found <phrase>``</phrase> <phrase>life</phrase> stinks '' to be one of <phrase>mel brooks</phrase> ' observant <phrase>films</phrase> where prior to being a <phrase>comedy</phrase> , it shows a tender side compared to his <phrase>slapstick</phrase> work such as <phrase>blazing saddles</phrase> , <phrase>young frankenstein</phrase> , or <phrase>spaceballs</phrase> for the <phrase>matter</phrase> , to show what it 's like having something valuable before losing it the next day or on the other hand making a stupid <phrase>bet</phrase> like all rich people do when they do n't know what to do with their <phrase>money</phrase> . maybe they should give it to the <phrase>homeless</phrase> instead of using it like <phrase>monopoly</phrase> <phrase>money</phrase> . or maybe this <phrase>film</phrase> will inspire you to help others .
one of the things that interested me most about this <phrase>film</phrase> is the way the characters and their associated histories are developed on the <phrase>fly</phrase> . i suppose the writers wanted us to gain interest in the characters by not <phrase>force feeding</phrase> their characters . the premise of using the <phrase>art</phrase> and craft of <phrase>furniture</phrase> <phrase>design</phrase> and <phrase>construction</phrase> was a unique theme and/or analogy for what families/siblings go through in <phrase>life</phrase> . the complexity of having a twin serve as a surrogate father and even husband added great tension towards making this <phrase>film</phrase> emotionally interesting . also , although the story was not one that the masses might directly relate to ( i.e . <phrase>jewish</phrase>/<phrase>twins</phrase>/<phrase>family</phrase> <phrase>business</phrase> ) the themes are fairly <phrase>universal</phrase> as every <phrase>family</phrase> has a <phrase>black</phrase> <phrase>sheep</phrase> in it . that made it very engaging .
every once in a while , someone out of the <phrase>blue</phrase> looks at me a little <phrase>sideways</phrase> and asks <phrase>``</phrase> what 's with snitch 'd '' ? i know immediately they have a case of barely-hidden <phrase>amusement</phrase> + <phrase>horror</phrase> . you see , i was the <phrase>cinematographer</phrase> on the <phrase>film</phrase> . let me clarify some points regarding this <phrase>``</phrase> interesting <phrase>life</phrase> experience '' . originally , snitch 'd was called one hard hit . i met james cahill in july of 1999 , a day after i wrapped <phrase>triangle</phrase> square , a great little 35mm feature that like so many <phrase>indie</phrase> features of the <phrase>era</phrase> never got distribution despite <phrase>festival</phrase> accolades ... it <phrase>fell</phrase> eternal victim to the <phrase>fine print</phrase> of <phrase>sag</phrase> 's notorious <phrase>experimental</phrase> feature <phrase>contract</phrase> . but i digress ... i though i was on a roll , and when james asked me to shoot his little <phrase>gangster</phrase> flick in 16mm with a <phrase>shooting</phrase> budget of about $ 25,000 , not wanting to break pace , i took it . after all , clerks , <phrase>el mariachi</phrase> ... i too believed the myth back then . let 's just <phrase>chalk</phrase> it up as <phrase>``</phrase> <phrase>film</phrase> <phrase>school</phrase> '' for many involved , myself included . snitch 'd was <phrase>shot</phrase> over two weeks in august , 1999 , in <phrase>aliso viejo</phrase> and <phrase>santa ana</phrase> , ca . cahill taught <phrase>drama</phrase> at a <phrase>high school</phrase> in the latter <phrase>city</phrase> ( yes , he is a <phrase>drama</phrase> and <phrase>english</phrase> <phrase>teacher</phrase> ... consider that while watching the <phrase>film</phrase> , or even observing the use of <phrase>apostrophe</phrase> in title ) , hence the locations and cast . of note in his cast were the only known dramatic appearance of l.a. 's <phrase>channel</phrase> 2 morning <phrase>news</phrase> <phrase>weather</phrase> girl vera jimenez , and of greater impact , the debut of <phrase>eva longoria</phrase> , who had just arrived in <phrase>hollywood</phrase> and was as eager as i to get a <phrase>film</phrase> under her belt . i must say her <phrase>professional</phrase> dedication , focus and <phrase>``</phrase> let 's do this '' attitude kept me inspired and was a foreshadow of her stardom-yet-to-come . snitch 'd suffered from poor <phrase>optics</phrase> , few lights or <phrase>electricity</phrase> , several boom operators du jour , and delivery of an uncorrected offline for duplication . none of that overshadows the actual content , which speaks for itself . anyway , by 2003 , the <phrase>film</phrase> was sold to distributors ( at a net loss , i understand ) who inexplicably had no photos of eva on the box ( by then she was a rising , working name ) but who did manage to obtain a clear photo of what appears to be an authentic <phrase>latino</phrase> <phrase>gangster</phrase> to lend credibility to snitch 'd . since cahill 's other passion is <phrase>antiquarian</phrase> <phrase>book</phrase> dealing , it appears to confirm he believes you can , in fact , <phrase>judge</phrase> a <phrase>book</phrase> by it 's <phrase>cover</phrase> ... as so many have picked up this <phrase>dvd</phrase> based on it 's sleeve . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - one year later , eva , now on a <phrase>soap</phrase> , and i met james for one day to shoot a simple <phrase>short film</phrase> he had concocted , <phrase>split</phrase> second , which i think has never seen any <phrase>play</phrase> despite <phrase>festival</phrase> intent . 6 years later , i was hired to shoot another cahill <phrase>film</phrase> titled juarez , <phrase>mexico</phrase> . i though he had worked out the process ; my participation was contingent on casting , script and crew control , and the resultant <phrase>film</phrase> actually looked promising in dailies , for what it was ... a cheap <phrase>detective</phrase> story surrounding the <phrase>mass</phrase> murders of girls in juarez ; despite claims here and elsewhere , the <phrase>film</phrase> has never appeared in any <phrase>festival</phrase> or venue , although cahill has repeatedly claimed the <phrase>film</phrase> has distribution and was simply awaiting release to coincide with the <phrase>dvd</phrase> release of two studio pictures on the same subject , <phrase>virgin</phrase> of juarez and border <phrase>town</phrase> .
i had some reservations about this <phrase>movie</phrase> , i figured it would be the usual bill of fare -- - a formula <phrase>movie</phrase> about <phrase>christmas</phrase> . being in the middle of a <phrase>heat wave</phrase> in late june , we decided to give it a <phrase>shot</phrase> anyway , maybe we would see some <phrase>snow</phrase> . this <phrase>movie</phrase> turned out to be one laugh after another . <phrase>ben affleck</phrase> was believable in his character , but the real <phrase>star</phrase> of this one is james gandofini . he delivered his lines with a real wit about him and made a great <phrase>``</phrase> dad '' . if you want to have an enjoyable couple of hours , definitely check this one out .
the only good thing about this unfunny dreck is that i did n't have to pay for it . i saw it for <phrase>free</phrase> at <phrase>college</phrase> . and if a <phrase>college</phrase> <phrase>student</phrase> ca n't find humor in something that was <phrase>free</phrase> , it 's hopeless . stale acting and poor jokes can not be masked by an excellent , yet bewildering <phrase>set design</phrase> ( that goes out of its way to market volkswagon <phrase>beetles</phrase> ) . i do n't know what michaels myers was doing in this <phrase>movie</phrase> , but i have never seen anything more depressing . this was nothing more than a blatant effort to capitalize on the previous success of the grinch ( which has its opponents , but i enjoyed it very much ) . it 's difficult not to sit through this failure and wonder what better projects were passed over to fund it . you want a funny seuss adaptation ? go with the grinch .
probably the worst <phrase>bollywood film</phrase> i 've seen . no <phrase>plot line</phrase> . very little character developments . full of silly and pointless humor . the whole <phrase>film</phrase> was chaotic and direction-less . there was no proper ending to the story . the <phrase>airport</phrase> was filmed in a <phrase>shopping mall</phrase> . same story chewed over and over again until you want to say <phrase>``</phrase> please , just move on with it ! ! '' even the <phrase>song</phrase> and <phrase>dance</phrase> was pointless and badly choreographed . the only good thing about this <phrase>movie</phrase> is that there were hot bods all around ... but then most of the <phrase>bollywood</phrase> movies have that anyways these days . btw i 'm not from an <phrase>indian</phrase> background 2/10
* * * slight spoilers * * * a hunchback 15-year-old boy kisses a very cute 15-year-old girl and eventually he has sex for the first time . after the <phrase>act</phrase> , he lays in the bed with her not touching her . the next day he concludes that he does not like sex much and does not want to try it again for at least a few years . this is seemingly a fine opening for a <phrase>teleplay</phrase> about a boy discovering his <phrase>homosexuality</phrase> , or perhaps a <phrase>medical drama</phrase> about a post-pubescent teen with a severe <phrase>hormone</phrase> deficiency . however , as the plot develops what emerges is a story of a 15-year-old father who is supported and encouraged by his overbearing mother . at one point , his mother preaches to her co-workers who are not as understanding as they might be , <phrase>``</phrase> every step of the way in this , my son has been amazing ... i have never been more proud of him ... '' the young father 's <phrase>older sister</phrase> , who otherwise is cold towards her brother , begins to show pride in her sibling , <phrase>``</phrase> you have been cool about this , '' as she gives him an encouraging warm hug . the 15-year-old father wants to be a father . he wants to be a parent . why not ? we see the <phrase>``</phrase> new '' baby a few minutes after birth -- it appears to be a healthy , happy 4-month-old <phrase>infant</phrase> . just as babies were born on <phrase>tv</phrase> in the 1960 's and 1970 's . once the young father is a parent , he has found happiness . he insists he will be the one to change the dirty <phrase>diaper</phrase> . we see the 15-year-old father sincerely happy holding his baby while the teen 's busy=body mother is peaking over his shoulder . fade to <phrase>black</phrase> .
yuck . i thought it odd that their ancient <phrase>book</phrase> on curses was made using a common script <phrase>font</phrase> instead of hand written . the acting is so apathetic at times and so over-dramatic at other times . why would a <phrase>``</phrase> demonico '' kill the two suspiciously quiet <phrase>doctors</phrase> who helped make him immortal ? just for the heck of it ? and is it really necessary to show <phrase>lilith</phrase> 's <phrase>motorcycle</phrase> whenever she 's out somewhere . we get it ! you spent a little <phrase>bit</phrase> of <phrase>money</phrase> to rent some <phrase>third rate</phrase> crotch <phrase>rocket</phrase> . it does n't mean you have to show it all the time ! the <phrase>``</phrase> <phrase>faith</phrase> 's '' lair looks like an old <phrase>school</phrase> <phrase>battlestar galactica</phrase> set with some last minute changes . there is a scene where we are introduced to a few people on a <phrase>talk</phrase> show for about 30 seconds before they are killed without apparent reason and without importance . everyone is a throwaway character . forgettable characters and an even more forgettable plot make this one of the most ill-conceived movies i 've seen the <phrase>scifi</phrase> <phrase>channel</phrase> come out with . stay away unless you 're into bad movies .
i just do n't get some of the big premises of this episode - that miranda is so remarkable , and that there 's anything so ugly it would make you insane . someone here made the remark that maybe it 's the <phrase>frequency</phrase> of the <phrase>light</phrase> waves or something rather than it being ugliness . miranda is just a <phrase>jerk</phrase> . the episode is slow , inconsistent and way too talky . i also do n't quite understand why kolos is an <phrase>ambassador</phrase> - why does n't the federation just leave the damn medusans be ? there 's one part i do like , when kolos is speaking through <phrase>spock</phrase> about the loneliness of the <phrase>human</phrase> experience . overall , i <phrase>love</phrase> tos and even at its lamest , i 'll always tune in . this episode though - mmm , i would n't purchase it except for a used copy under $ 3 .
i gave it an 8 only because it had received such low votes ... this is definitely really about a 5.5 ..... ummm .. it was kind of bloody , had likeable , shallow characters , and it had some really hot babes in it . i like the eclectic killer , because he did n't kill people the same way <phrase>everytime</phrase> ... that sometimes gets old .
i think the biggest disappointment in this <phrase>film</phrase> was that , right until the end , i expected the acting instructors of the cast to break in and apologize for how poor the acting was . when you consider the powerful subject , the brilliant scenery and the effort made in creating a wonderful set and spectacular images , it is a shame that little attention was given to acting .
when <phrase>paris</phrase> is burning came out , i totally dismissed it . i was not into the whole <phrase>madonna</phrase> and vogueing phenomenon . i thought it was going to be campy and silly . how wrong i was about this <phrase>movie</phrase> . i watched it after the <phrase>movie</phrase> had been out for ten years and i ran out and bought it . it took me back to a time and place of fun and excitement . i felt as though i knew all of the characters personally . the 80s were spectacular and the <phrase>movie</phrase> captured the essence of the <phrase>gay</phrase> <phrase>culture</phrase> . what a terrific job ! i went on the <phrase>internet</phrase> and found out what some of the original casts members were doing now but i have not been able to locate all of them . if any one has any <phrase>information</phrase> on any of the casts members please let me know . i hope they make another <phrase>documentary</phrase> . i loved it
always enjoy great <phrase>films</phrase> which deal with the super-natural and the deep thoughts of the spiritual world . however , this <phrase>film</phrase> just turned me off as far as its <phrase>production</phrase> and direction . there is nothing to go into deep discussion about what this story has to tell ; all i can say is that it was a big waste of time and effort to put it on the <phrase>big screen</phrase> . the <phrase>actors</phrase> , namely : <phrase>mark addy</phrase> , <phrase>thomas garrett</phrase> , gave an outstanding performance in his <phrase>native</phrase> land <phrase>england</phrase> , and we have seen him in <phrase>``</phrase> still standing '' a <phrase>tv</phrase> series . <phrase>heath</phrase> ledger , played the real wicked dude and we have recently viewed him in <phrase>``</phrase> <phrase>brokeback mountain</phrase> '' , '05 , gave a great <phrase>supporting role</phrase> . shannyn sossaman , ( mara sinclair ) , did a good job of seducing a <phrase>priest</phrase> from a <phrase>church</phrase> not recognized by any <phrase>faith</phrase> . do n't waste your time , you will be sorry !
leon was fantastic as always , this time playing little richard in his early years . the <phrase>movie</phrase> showed a fully fleshed out little richard without neglecting to fill the show with lots of great <phrase>music</phrase> . my only complaint is that the ending was a little abrupt - i was hoping for a 2-parter !
first off , anyone who thinks this <phrase>sequel</phrase> to <phrase>william friedkin</phrase> 's <phrase>``</phrase> the <phrase>french</phrase> connection '' , is <phrase>superior</phrase> is most definitely completely insane or moronic or both . the problem with reviewing this <phrase>film</phrase> is that , a . ) it 's a <phrase>sequel</phrase> to a brilliant <phrase>movie</phrase> , which always makes watching it objectively difficult , and b . ) it 's <phrase>directed</phrase> by john frankenhimer , one of the best <phrase>american</phrase> <phrase>directors</phrase> ever , so i wanted to like it . william friendkin was the perfect person to direct a <phrase>film</phrase> about <phrase>drug</phrase> traffic in decaying new <phrase>york</phrase> <phrase>city</phrase> , because of his <phrase>documentary</phrase>-like approach to the <phrase>action</phrase> and story , frankenhimer on the other hand is one of the most stylish <phrase>directors</phrase> ever , i.e . <phrase>``</phrase> the manchurian candidate '' and <phrase>``</phrase> seconds '' , and with his <phrase>``</phrase> <phrase>french</phrase> connection 2 '' it feels like someone trying to be gritty and not having the true understanding to pull it off . that fact that frankenhimer was chosen to direct the <phrase>sequel</phrase> by <phrase>gene</phrase> hackman himself really tells a lot about hackman 's understanding about the original <phrase>film</phrase> too . it 's well known hackman hated friedkin on the set and vowed to never work with him again , it 's also known he envisioned the character to be more one dimensional , loosing weight and trying to <phrase>play</phrase> him like a straight character . it shows you hackman , despite being a great <phrase>actor</phrase> , had no idea who to make the <phrase>movie</phrase> and the story great . the plot point of doyle becoming an addict is interesting , but does n't warrant the rest of the <phrase>film</phrase> . an unfortunate low point in frankenhimer 's filmography .
<phrase>curly sue</phrase> is a 6 year old with an abundance of <phrase>hair</phrase> and a <phrase>life</phrase> as a drifter . she and her father , bill ( <phrase>jim belushi</phrase> ) , try to survive on the streets by being small time con artists . in <phrase>chicago</phrase> , bill decides to jump in front of a <phrase>car</phrase> in a pricey parking <phrase>garage</phrase> while curly will scream about lawsuits and traction to the intended victim . it happens to be a very upscale <phrase>lawyer</phrase> named grey ( <phrase>kelly lynch</phrase> ) who is appropriately appalled at what she has done . not only do the scammers make some cash , they get to spend the night at grey 's <phrase>plush</phrase> <phrase>apartment</phrase> . even then , grey feels she owes them more so the three of them hang together for a spell . grey only knows the lucrative <phrase>law</phrase> <phrase>business</phrase> and nothing about <phrase>life</phrase> . who better to teach her than bill and curly , those savvy experts on <phrase>life</phrase> 's realities ? but , all good things must come to an end and there is no <phrase>life</phrase> for a legal expert and a couple of con men . or is there ? this is a sweet and funny <phrase>movie</phrase> about the unexpected . curly is certainly as entertaining as <phrase>shirley temple</phrase> but much edgier , of course . belushi gives a rare touching performance as the down on his luck con and lynch is luminous as the snooty but soft touch <phrase>lawyer</phrase> . <phrase>john hughes</phrase> , as <phrase>writer</phrase> and <phrase>director</phrase> , shows us his magic touch once again , as the script is lively and unpredictable . just <phrase>watch</phrase> curly and bill take grey out for a night , with no <phrase>money</phrase> , and see the humorous <phrase>results</phrase> . do you <phrase>long</phrase> for <phrase>happy endings</phrase> , <phrase>long</phrase> promised and finally delivered , with a few uncertain moments in between ? this is your made-to-<phrase>order</phrase> <phrase>movie</phrase> .
so , i know that i voted 1 out of 10 but really this deserves no more than half of a <phrase>star</phrase> . i hated it . it was so stupid and unrealistic , i ca n't believe any of the <phrase>stars</phrase> signed on to make this ridiculously absurd project . james g. and cathrine o'hara were excellent in their characters and <phrase>ben affleck</phrase> and <phrase>christina applegate</phrase> were just as good too , but the story sucked and i encourage anyone who sees this in the <phrase>video</phrase> store to not even bother picking it up and <phrase>reading</phrase> the back <phrase>cover</phrase> , but to just walk away ... i do n't even want to get into what the <phrase>movie</phrase> is about , because it is too stupid to pontificate about . do n't rent this ! it 's horrible ! horrible !
story about four <phrase>teenage girls</phrase> growing up in <phrase>california</phrase> . jeanie ( <phrase>jodie foster</phrase> ) is the most level-headed of the bunch -- but wants to move out of her <phrase>house</phrase> where she lives with her divorced mother ( <phrase>sally kellerman</phrase> ) . annie ( <phrase>cherie</phrase> currie ) is addicted to <phrase>drugs</phrase> , <phrase>alcohol</phrase> and bad boys and is beaten up by her father . madge ( marilyn <phrase>kagan</phrase> ) has overprotective parents . deirde ( kandice <phrase>stroh</phrase> ) thinks she 's more mature than the rest of them . this is nothing new from what we 've seen plenty of times before -- but this one has one big difference -- it 's accurate . i graduated from <phrase>high school</phrase> in 1980 ( when i first saw the <phrase>film</phrase> ) and i was surprised at how realistic it was . they got the dialogue , clothes and attitudes down completely right . even the main <phrase>song</phrase> of the <phrase>movie</phrase> ( <phrase>``</phrase> on the <phrase>radio</phrase> '' by <phrase>donna summer</phrase> ) was a big hit before this came out . this <phrase>film</phrase> hit me harder than any other <phrase>teen film</phrase> of the time because i could understand and relate to the characters . i knew girls in <phrase>high school</phrase> who were just like this ! the <phrase>film</phrase> is ( of course ) dated but it captures a time we will never see again . the acting is good on all counts with foster giving the best performance . the relationship between her and kellerman ( who was excellent ) was realistic and well-done . even <phrase>scott baio</phrase> ( who has a <phrase>small role</phrase> as a friend of the girls ) more or less realistically played a teen boy . a very good <phrase>movie</phrase> -- essential viewing if you came of age in 1980 . the <phrase>film</phrase> has a deserved r rating ( plenty of <phrase>drug</phrase> use and swearing ) but should be seen by all teens . i give it a 8 .
this 2003 made for <phrase>tv</phrase> <phrase>movie</phrase> was shown on a women 's <phrase>channel</phrase> , naturally . as a man , why do i even attempt to <phrase>watch</phrase> this ? i do n't know , but i should have my head examined . and <phrase>director</phrase> and <phrase>writer</phrase> simon gornick should be ashamed of himself to give men an injustice as he does . he takes away any strength and conviction a man could have by having several boring women do him in . number one bore is <phrase>joyce</phrase> hyser as the wife . i could n't wait for him to drop her . her revenge was silly and stupid and very confusing through most of the <phrase>movie</phrase> . the other <phrase>femme fatale</phrase> was nichole hiltz , about the coldest person you 'd ever want to meet . her looks did n't warrant our <phrase>leading man</phrase> to go that ape over her and her acting was so obvious , only a fool could miss . definitely a loser . tembi <phrase>locke</phrase> was pretty good , but slow on the uptake as to the <phrase>slut</phrase> seducing her own husband , again played as a guy who is a loser , by <phrase>david</phrase> deluise . rounding out our cast of losers is anthony denison as a boss who has little to do but scowl at our <phrase>hero</phrase> . stephen jenkins as our <phrase>hero</phrase> , or should i say victim , was not that good . at first i thought he just a bad <phrase>actor</phrase> , but later i believed it . he never got the part off the ground and was repetitive throughout . although , as a man , i became enraged when the two women got away with it . men , beware of this <phrase>channel</phrase> that puts men down and women get away even with <phrase>murder</phrase> . lmn is the <phrase>channel</phrase> . beware . note : having watched this a second time by mistake , i am convinced on my initial thoughts . especially on the <phrase>writer</phrase>/<phrase>director</phrase> , simon gornick . i still believe he has disgraced the male <phrase>species</phrase> and should be <phrase>horse</phrase> whipped . only <phrase>saving grace</phrase> in this <phrase>film</phrase> is tembi <phrase>locke</phrase> who does n't have a chance to show her talents with the awful acting of jenkins , hyser , hiltz and deluise around her . plus the stupid plot that only makes it worse . down with gornick 's <phrase>movie</phrase> and his vacant <phrase>stars</phrase> in it . please lmn do n't show this trite again .
the number of times i 've had tears in my eyes when watching a <phrase>movie</phrase> are few . and there is only one time when i have really cried and that was when i saw this <phrase>movie</phrase> . this <phrase>movie</phrase> has some kliches but i really do n't care . i cry even as i write this and it was quite some time since i saw it . it is perfectly acted and all the <phrase>production</phrase> values are good , but what really matters is the simple and wonderful message . we all know it in our <phrase>hearts</phrase> , but it is not always easy to remember that the only thing that really matters in <phrase>life</phrase> is <phrase>love</phrase> in all it 's forms . it 's only when we <phrase>love</phrase> that we 're truly alive . i know how sentimental i <phrase>sound</phrase> and i promise i 'm not usually like that . i 'm quite a cynic . this <phrase>movie</phrase> has brought out stronger feelings of both sorrow and happiness in me than any other movies and it will probably always be the first <phrase>movie</phrase> i recommend others to see .
this is easily one of the worst 5 movies i 've ever seen . it 's not scary or any of the other things suggested in the <phrase>plot outline</phrase> . this <phrase>movie</phrase> is agonizingly slow and i was bored for almost all 98 minutes . while the acting is mediocre at best , the <phrase>biggest problem</phrase> is the script , which is <phrase>poorly written</phrase> , slow and plodding with no real direction . occasionally an eerie mood is set only to be broken by some useless line or event . i 'm not surprised that the entire cast was sick and throwing up between shots , they did after all have to try and digest a <phrase>terrible script</phrase> . as a huge fan of good <phrase>horror</phrase> movies , i 'm always irritated that something this bad gets made . save yourself 98 minutes you 'll never get back .
from the very beginning i was so excited to see this <phrase>movie</phrase> . the <phrase>poster</phrase> is possibly the funniest i 've ever seen for a <phrase>movie</phrase> . i immediately bought one for my dorm this september . every element came together in this <phrase>movie</phrase> so beautifully . it 's not often you see a <phrase>movie</phrase> with so many <phrase>penis</phrase> , <phrase>gay</phrase> , and racial jokes so praised by critics . carell and the rest of the cast deliver each raunchy joke sensationally . carell remains sweet throughout the entire <phrase>movie</phrase> where by the end of the <phrase>movie</phrase> you 're rooting for him to succeed in his relationship more than you are for him to get laid . the <phrase>supporting cast</phrase> is brutal , each of them having some problems with the ladies themselves . one of the things about this <phrase>movie</phrase> is the abundance of memorable scenes we 're given . this is what makes a <phrase>movie</phrase> easy to remember fondly . this <phrase>movie</phrase> will often be brought up when the words <phrase>``</phrase> chest waxing '' and <phrase>``</phrase> <phrase>condoms</phrase> '' are mentioned in conversation . watching it in the <phrase>theater</phrase> i was surprised how many older people were there to <phrase>watch</phrase> it . i saw a group of four mid-60s women come in . despite an older audience , this <phrase>movie</phrase> still filled the entire <phrase>theater</phrase> with laughter . i think the type of people who will like this are the fans of the office and <phrase>steve carell</phrase> . a lot of the jokes remind me of the type of jokes you 'd see on <phrase>family</phrase> guy , too . the <phrase>movie</phrase> is shallow enough for adolescent boys and still sweet and clever enough for <phrase>middle aged</phrase> women . i do n't recommend going to this <phrase>movie</phrase> if you are n't a fan of <phrase>profanity</phrase> or if you are easily offended . however , when you are at the <phrase>movie</phrase> , just remember this <phrase>movie</phrase> is all in good humor . the jokes are n't <phrase>``</phrase> <phrase>gay</phrase> jokes , '' they 're just jokes . and they 're funny .
it 's very very funny . you know , just like a <phrase>comedy</phrase> is supposed to be . it also looks very very good , like a <phrase>hollywood</phrase> spectacular should . so , what more do you want ? howz about a very very good sally fields . she is so much better here than in anything else i 've ever seen her in , and she looks so damn good . this <phrase>movie</phrase> is all you need to understand why she 's a <phrase>star</phrase> . those eyes ! like a <phrase>silent movie</phrase> <phrase>star</phrase> , but better . in fact , everyone 's eyes are so good . i used to pretend to be a bad <phrase>tv</phrase> <phrase>soap</phrase> <phrase>actor</phrase> with my girlfriend . we 'd do that thing where you look real fast from one eye to the other of your partner . they do n't do that at all in <phrase>soap</phrase> dish . great . the eyes have it ! ( sorry ) there 's so many terrific performances , its fun just waiting for each of them to reappear . there 's a whole workshop going on with <phrase>kevin kline</phrase> on how to overact very very subtly . got that ? yeah , he 's damn good . so is <phrase>robert downey</phrase> , <phrase>jr</phrase>. who has since made sumthin of a career of playing the slick , slimy executive . cathy moriarity , while not the most gifted <phrase>actress</phrase> , is so charismatic and riveting , especially when she 's angry . and even <phrase>whoopi goldberg</phrase> is decent , her natural timing giving here somewhat flat delivery a little zing . <phrase>ok</phrase> , no <phrase>whoopi</phrase> bashing , i hear ya . and then , there 's the <phrase>hair</phrase> . <phrase>soap</phrase> dish was made at the end of the <phrase>big hair</phrase> eighties , so the ridiculous doos are like a great character in themselves . they get bigger and sillier , just like your 's did . yeah , we got pictures . <phrase>soap</phrase> dish is better than i thought it 'd be , better that i wanted it to be . i 'm sick of movies that tell me i 'm supposed to care about shallow , self centered , semi-talented egomaniacs , ie . <phrase>tv</phrase> <phrase>soap</phrase> <phrase>actors</phrase> . <phrase>soap</phrase> dish seems happy just to have me laugh at 'em . thank you .
another review likened this troupe to a cross between <phrase>monty python</phrase> and <phrase>twin peaks</phrase> , also aptly . yet another review expounded on the differences between the <phrase>comedy</phrase> we enjoy non-critically and <phrase>black comedy</phrase> , also well worth consideration . <phrase>watch</phrase> the whole thing , all three series . at the end , all the characters are tied up and the <phrase>puzzle</phrase> pieces fall into place just as well as a <phrase>douglas adams</phrase> novel . the detail and intricacies are staggering . thoroughly <phrase>post-modern</phrase> . wickedly funny , and startlingly tragic . not for kids . not for those with thin skins or who lack objectivity . <phrase>thought-provoking</phrase> . at once literal , figurative , and surreal in disturbing ways . the blackest <phrase>comedy</phrase> i can recall . and very possibly the most wonderful thing i will ever see .
well i just gave away 95 minutes and 47 seconds that i 'll never get back on this piece of trash . i heard someone online describe this <phrase>movie</phrase> 's villains as <phrase>``</phrase> subhuman cannibals '' , and i thought it was promising because i thought it would be like the descent . wrong ! the descent was a <phrase>psychological thriller</phrase> with dynamic characters and strong storyline . these villains are totally unrealistic and no part of their performance is enjoyable to <phrase>watch</phrase> . this <phrase>movie</phrase> is n't so controversial , i 've seen this level of <phrase>gore</phrase> in many <phrase>films</phrase> . this <phrase>movie</phrase> plain sucks . synopsis : a blonde who thinks she 's real hot ( but she is n't ) , her admirer , and her admirer 's friend ( no , i do n't remember their names ) go into the woods . their <phrase>car</phrase> breaks down . they are warned to leave by a man named mark . the blonde gets unreasonably hysterical and the next morning they ca n't find the admirer 's friend . admirer impales his foot ( whoops ! ) . do n't worry , he is much more upset when his <phrase>car</phrase> wo n't start than when he gets impaled by nails . after a <phrase>nanosecond</phrase> of coaxing , the blond <phrase>leaves</phrase> to find help . events ensue that i can not remember . during this and throughout the <phrase>movie</phrase> , we are shown <phrase>grotesque</phrase> <phrase>torture</phrase> scenes with no substance including one that made me gag . blonde goes to save admirer from <phrase>house</phrase> of cannibals ( even though all they are seen eating is intestines , which would logically be the last choice for real cannibals to eat since they contain actual <phrase>food</phrase> ) . blonde finds admirer hurt and works very hard ( unsuccessfully ) to work up tears . then you get a good laugh when the blonde is in the <phrase>house</phrase> and announces she can <phrase>``</phrase> out think them '' . mark ( the man who warned them to leave ) has a remarkable change of character when he reveals the cannibals are his <phrase>family</phrase> . then there is some <phrase>shooting</phrase> , they leave the <phrase>house</phrase> , the <phrase>shooting</phrase> continues , then a random guy shows up and says he 's been watching them . before he is <phrase>shot</phrase> , we are shown an <phrase>acid</phrase>-trip inspired scene of more killing . the blonde or her admirer shoots him because he did not help them . there 's more killing , the admirer professes his <phrase>love</phrase> for the blonde . then a mysterious hand covers the <phrase>camera</phrase> . what does that imply ? i do n't know , hopefully not a <phrase>sequel</phrase> .
in this extremely <phrase>low-budget</phrase> ( i 've seen <phrase>home movies</phrase> made with better <phrase>production</phrase> value ) <phrase>australian</phrase> utter rip-off of <phrase>``</phrase> the burning '' & <phrase>``</phrase> friday the 13th '' , a <phrase>band</phrase> is planning to make a <phrase>music video</phrase> while on a <phrase>houseboat</phrase> . they 're stalked by a <phrase>serial killer</phrase> who was burned years before . this <phrase>movie</phrase> is even proclaimed to be 'the worst <phrase>australian</phrase> <phrase>film</phrase> ever made ' in it 's <phrase>dvd</phrase> promotional material . that 's it 's only selling point ! complete and utter rubbish in every considerable way . perhaps a few <phrase>chuckles</phrase> here and there for bad <phrase>movie</phrase> lovers , but it still made me want to burn out my retinas . <phrase>eye candy</phrase> : a quick <phrase>flash</phrase> of barely existent itty bitty titties in a lame <phrase>shower scene</phrase> my grade : f
you know this is <phrase>gon na</phrase> be a cheesy <phrase>movie</phrase> when : 1 . it was made it the 50 's 2 . it 's in <phrase>black</phrase> and <phrase>white</phrase> . 3 . it has no name <phrase>actors</phrase> ! 4 . screaming makes up for the lack of <phrase>special effects</phrase> ! well not to be outdone - this <phrase>movie</phrase> brilliantly incorporated all four of the above elements to turn this into a true cinematic blunder . okay - shhhhh but i am <phrase>gon na</phrase> discuss <phrase>special effects</phrase> here - or lack of them - did you catch the underwater scenes ? it looks like it was poorly filmed through an <phrase>aquarium</phrase> - note the cape flapping in the breeze . and the repeated re-use of <phrase>stock</phrase> footage , ( exterior <phrase>house</phrase> shots , the bridges scenes -- great enhanced the k-r-a-f-tiness of this <phrase>film</phrase> - not since <phrase>``</phrase> <phrase>plan 9</phrase> '' - have i seen such creative usage of <phrase>stock</phrase> footage . and hey where there was a lack of <phrase>special effects</phrase> - not to worry - screaming does take the place of <phrase>special effects</phrase> in this <phrase>movie</phrase> as well . yes this <phrase>movie</phrase> even cleverly used that old hack trick . grab the <phrase>popcorn</phrase> - set your <phrase>brain</phrase> on stun ( several fermented beverages definitely helps ) , sit back , and wonder : why the heck did they put this on <phrase>film</phrase> again ? wayno
sorry , but aside from <phrase>kim basinger</phrase> doing a good job acting scared , this was one of the worst thrillers i 've seen in awhile . <phrase>logic</phrase> is thrown out as 4 young guys terrorize this woman outside a crowded <phrase>mall</phrase> then shoot a <phrase>security</phrase> <phrase>guard</phrase> . yet no one seems to notice . then , instead of screaming for help or racing back to the <phrase>mall</phrase> , she drives off and ends up in the middle of the woods with the guys in hot pursuit . i ca n't even describe how silly it is seeing this woman fleeing from 4 retarded thugs , carrying a <phrase>red</phrase> toolbox , screaming for <phrase>god</phrase> to come help her , and then having sex with one of them after brutally killing the others . please trust me , this is bad and a <phrase>bit</phrase> tasteless as well .
on the surface , <phrase>``</phrase> show me the <phrase>money</phrase> '' should have at least finished a full <phrase>season</phrase> . you had the always entertaining <phrase>william shatner</phrase> as your host , surrounded by a baker 's dozen of beautiful leggy models collectively called <phrase>``</phrase> the <phrase>million dollar</phrase> dancers . '' you had knowledgeable contestants who had interesting stories to tell of their lives and who presumably knew a lot of <phrase>pop culture</phrase> trivia . and you had big <phrase>money</phrase> ! so , what went wrong ? the format of this <phrase>game</phrase> was the failure . a good <phrase>game</phrase> show needs at least two of three things : very simple rules , exciting pacing and the ability for the viewer to <phrase>play</phrase> along at home . the best , most enduring ones have all three . unfortunately , smtm had none . the rules for this <phrase>game</phrase> were among the most complex of any prime time <phrase>game</phrase> show in <phrase>history</phrase> . let me try to explain how the <phrase>game</phrase> worked , as briefly as possible . a contestant began with a <phrase>single</phrase> word or <phrase>short</phrase> phrase followed by the choice letters a , b , c ( subtle plug for the network ? ) . each letter was connected to a separate question , all starting with that word or phrase . once a contestant chose one of the letters , they could either answer that question or <phrase>pass</phrase> and select a second letter . if they passed , they got to view the next question , and had the same option . however , if they passed the second question , they were required to answer the third option . after they answered and before they found out if their answer was correct , they then had to select one of the 13 dancers on stage , each with a different amount of <phrase>money</phrase> in a scroll by their side . they revealed their dollar amount ( ranging from $ 20,000 to $ 250,000 ) and depending on if the contestant answered right ... or answered wrong ... that amount would be added to or subtracted from their pot . still with me so far ? in addition , there was one <phrase>dancer</phrase> who held something known as <phrase>``</phrase> the killer <phrase>card</phrase> . '' if you selected the <phrase>dancer</phrase> with the killer <phrase>card</phrase> and you had gotten your question right , you were safe , and the <phrase>game</phrase> continued . if , however , you were incorrect , you had one final question to answer . if you got that final question wrong , you were out of the <phrase>game</phrase> . if you got it right , then , the <phrase>game</phrase> continued . there was no quitting , no walking away with the <phrase>money</phrase> earned until you either answered six questions correctly or got six questions wrong or you were so far in the hole you could n't earn enough <phrase>money</phrase> to get back out . got it ? okay ! the <phrase>biggest problem</phrase> , as i saw it , was a complete lack of tension , because of the <phrase>design</phrase> of the <phrase>game</phrase> . a contestant could <phrase>pass</phrase> questions they knew they did n't know , and answer many questions they did know , making the <phrase>pressure</phrase> even less . then , they could still find a low dollar amount , even after knowingly missing a question , which meant there still was n't any <phrase>``</phrase> <phrase>drama</phrase> . '' and the fact that they could answer five questions wrong and still have a chance to win was a <phrase>big mistake</phrase> . and the pacing of the questions was deadly slow : often the questions were so obvious , it was ridiculous to try to create tension , as if there was any doubt about some of the most common answers . the pacing , the lack of any real tension at any point during the show and those very complicated rules prevented this program from working , despite shatner 's terpsichorean talents .
a <phrase>chinese</phrase> <phrase>ghost</phrase> story <phrase>stars</phrase> the late , great <phrase>leslie cheung</phrase> as ling choi <phrase>sin</phrase> , a penniless <phrase>tax</phrase> collector who decides to spend the night at a deserted <phrase>temple</phrase> , where he meets and <phrase>falls</phrase> for a beautiful woman called tsing ( joey wang ) . when ling discovers that tsing is actually a <phrase>ghost</phrase> who has been forced to seduce victims for an evil <phrase>tree</phrase> <phrase>spirit</phrase> who feeds on 'chi ' ( <phrase>life</phrase> force ) , he decides to try and <phrase>free</phrase> the girl by giving her remains a proper <phrase>burial</phrase> . enlisting the help of swordsman yin ( <phrase>wu ma</phrase> ) , a crazy <phrase>taoist</phrase> <phrase>monk</phrase> , ling successfully defeats the <phrase>tree</phrase> <phrase>spirit</phrase> , but must also do battle in hell against the evil <phrase>lord</phrase> <phrase>black</phrase> , to whom tsing is due to be wed . the first <phrase>hong kong</phrase> <phrase>film</phrase> that i saw which was n't purely <phrase>martial arts</phrase> <phrase>action</phrase> , a <phrase>chinese</phrase> <phrase>ghost</phrase> story opened my eyes to the incredible world of <phrase>asian</phrase> <phrase>fantasy</phrase> <phrase>horror</phrase> , a magical realm inhabited by beautiful female ghosts , bumbling innocent heroes , <phrase>sword</phrase> wielding <phrase>taoist</phrase> <phrase>monks</phrase> , monstrous spirits , and dark <phrase>lords</phrase> of the <phrase>underworld</phrase> ; i instantly <phrase>fell</phrase> in <phrase>love</phrase> with the <phrase>film</phrase> 's exuberance , <phrase>energy</phrase> , humour , inventiveness and visual excellence . two decades later , and this amazing <phrase>movie</phrase> still remains one of the finest examples of its <phrase>genre</phrase> that i have seena sumptuous , breathtaking masterpiece that brilliantly blends <phrase>horror</phrase> , <phrase>comedy</phrase> , <phrase>fantasy</phrase> and <phrase>romance</phrase> . with superb direction from siu-tung ching , excellent <phrase>editing</phrase> from <phrase>david</phrase> wu , stunning <phrase>cinematography</phrase> , and a whole slew of imaginative <phrase>special effects</phrase> ( including a humongous killer <phrase>tongue</phrase> , a many tentacled monster , and multiple flying heads ! ) , a <phrase>chinese</phrase> <phrase>ghost</phrase> story is a completely unforgettable and thoroughly enjoyable experience from start to finish .
i already know that critics and some audiences say that it was a <phrase>satire</phrase> , there were numerous <phrase>political</phrase> and social messages , the names make refer to some other names etc . it might be . i can not realize such things ( i do n't want to do anyway ) because i am not interested in , i am interested in 'cinema ' . as for the <phrase>movie</phrase> itself , again it is said that the <phrase>movie</phrase> is clever and dramatically powerful . i could not see anything which we do n't see in monster movies except the scene which <phrase>takes place</phrase> in a office in the second half . yes , that scene says somethings about humanity , but it does not make the <phrase>movie</phrase> brilliant . the <phrase>movie</phrase> is entertaining ( mildly ) and exciting in some moments or scenes , but no more than that . as for the biggest flaw of the <phrase>movie</phrase> , it is <phrase>visual effects</phrase> . it was just shocking , i could not pull myself together for a while , because i had expected a realistic monster , because it is not one of the old <phrase>gojira</phrase> movies , it was made in 2006 , but it was not . it is like if you do n't believe that there is a monster , you can not care about . if you agree with me about this , i <phrase>highly recommend</phrase> you <phrase>cloverfield</phrase> that is extremely realistic . the <phrase>design</phrase> of the monster is not interesting , but at least planned , there is an effort . dramatically powerful critique . some critics <phrase>talk</phrase> about it as if it is a <phrase>kurosawa</phrase> <phrase>movie</phrase> . yes , it is rather a <phrase>drama</phrase> than a <phrase>thriller</phrase> or <phrase>action</phrase> , but it should not mean that it is dramatically powerful . i do n't want to compare the host with other monster movies , but i try to mean that the host does not do something that other monster movies do not do . by the way , may be some people call the <phrase>movie</phrase> masterpiece because of their sympathy for <phrase>asian</phrase> cinema . yes , i like <phrase>asian</phrase> cinema too , but this is the fact .
this <phrase>film</phrase> is one of those <phrase>nostalgia</phrase> things with me and i never really expect anyone else to <phrase>``</phrase> get it '' but am pleased when i recommend it and somebody does enjoy it . my late father hated <phrase>arthur askey</phrase> but this <phrase>film</phrase> was one he really enjoyed and his consistent enthusiasm for <phrase>``</phrase> the <phrase>ghost</phrase> <phrase>train</phrase> '' and <phrase>``</phrase> old ted 'olmes '' transferred to me as a child . years later , i <phrase>watch</phrase> it every now and again , enjoying the familiarity . i always wonder if it will not be quite the same but i am never disappointed in it . there is much to enjoy . the <phrase>sequence</phrase> on the <phrase>train</phrase> is truly inspired when askey and <phrase>murdoch</phrase> proceed to annoy the arrogant male passenger . then the whole section in the <phrase>station</phrase> is amazing with so much going on you have to keep up . yes , it is dated and full of <phrase>wartime</phrase> <phrase>britishness</phrase> in accents and plot ( based on the original <phrase>play</phrase> by <phrase>arnold ridley</phrase> of dad 's <phrase>army</phrase> fame ! ) but full of wonderful character performances - including <phrase>kathleen harrison</phrase> as a dotty <phrase>spinster</phrase> . the <phrase>atmosphere</phrase> is truly as near sinister as an <phrase>arthur askey</phrase> vehicle could get . this is available cheap as chips in the <phrase>uk</phrase> on <phrase>dvd</phrase> so treat yourself . it is a perfect saturday/sunday morning or any day lazy afternoon <phrase>lightweight</phrase> piece of <phrase>entertainment</phrase> . i thank you .... old movies can be good movies !
first off , i would like to point out that the reason why i gave this <phrase>movie</phrase> 1 <phrase>star</phrase> out of 10 is because there is no option to give it no <phrase>stars</phrase> ! it really is that bad ! i was never eager to see this <phrase>film</phrase> after i saw the ads for it , i ended up seeing it only by chance because some <phrase>friends</phrase> of mine had tickets and had one spare so i tagged along . before seeing it i had a fairly good idea that it would n't be genius - the premise seemed far too silly and stupid for anything good to come out of it , but at the back of my mind i was thinking <phrase>``</phrase> but there must be something good about it for <phrase>uma thurman</phrase> and <phrase>luke</phrase> wilson do to the <phrase>film</phrase> ... '' not that i think either of them are particularly terrific but they are big-named <phrase>stars</phrase> who would normally only do <phrase>films</phrase> that would enhance their reputations . however , about 10-20 minutes into the feature i realized that the <phrase>movie</phrase> was probably worse than i had at first anticipated . i was shocked at how terrible the script was . it really gave the <phrase>actors</phrase> nothing to work with , so much so that they really looked like they did n't know what they were doing ( especially <phrase>luke</phrase> wilson ) . the story was completely predictable - if you 've seen the <phrase>ad</phrase> then you 've pretty much seen the <phrase>movie</phrase> ! and there was nothing original about it - it pretty much borrows from every '<phrase>super-hero</phrase> ' story that has ever been which would be acceptable had the <phrase>film</phrase> been set up as a <phrase>satire</phrase> of that <phrase>genre</phrase> , but alas it was n't . the direction seemed to be of realism . i got the feeling that the <phrase>director</phrase> wanted the <phrase>film</phrase> to feel completely realistic and not <phrase>satire</phrase> at all , and yet there were some moments in the <phrase>film</phrase> that were so unbelievably unrealistic that it would have worked if it were a <phrase>satire</phrase> . at one moment in the <phrase>movie</phrase> two of the characters seem to die and one of the surviving characters has a line like <phrase>``</phrase> oh well , she 's dead ... time to move on '' and he says it in such a droll voice that it completely did n't make any sense . i found myself checking my <phrase>watch</phrase> after about 40 minutes to see how much longer i would have to sit through it . and then it struck me ... i began to think <phrase>``</phrase> i wonder if the studio have made this picture as a <phrase>test</phrase> to see if they can make the worst possible <phrase>movie</phrase> ever made , and still pull a large audience ... '' i could n't think of any other reason why this <phrase>film</phrase> would be made . for movies to be made these days , the script goes to a massive screening process and very very few scripts actually make it to the <phrase>production</phrase> stage ... i ca n't comprehend how this one got past the first draft stage ... by the end , and exceedingly , dumb-founding-ly stupid climax , i was laughing heartily - just not at what the <phrase>film</phrase>-makers wanted me to laugh at , but instead at how ridiculous and stupid the <phrase>movie</phrase> was . thank <phrase>god</phrase> i did n't have to pay <phrase>money</phrase> to see it ... because that would have really annoyed me ! ! ! oh , and could i just add , that of the two wilson brothers , i have always preferred <phrase>luke</phrase> because i think he is a better , more versatile <phrase>actor</phrase> ... but if he wants to step even further into owen 's shadow then this is exactly the way to do it ... i doubt that he will get many more job offers after this crappy waste of 2 hours ! ! ! and remember , it only got a generous 1/10 because i could n't select 0 !
this is an amazing <phrase>film</phrase> to <phrase>watch</phrase> or show young people . aside from a very brief <phrase>nude scene</phrase> , it gives an interesting glimpse into colonial rule in <phrase>africa</phrase> that you 'll rarely find in other <phrase>films</phrase> . it does <phrase>bear</phrase> a superficial similarity to out of <phrase>africa</phrase> , but without all the <phrase>romantic</phrase> fluff . the <phrase>white</phrase> <phrase>french</phrase> people in <phrase>cameroon</phrase> are fascinating because they do n't even seem to regard the natives as people . the whites are all the bosses and they expect <phrase>black</phrase> servitude without question . however , unlike real servants , you only once hear any of the whites say 'thank you ' and no other regard is given these people . again and again , it 's like they are pets or <phrase>slaves</phrase> , as the feelings of the people are never even considered . the central <phrase>illustration</phrase> of this thoughtlessness is the relationship between the mother , aimée and her servant , protée . although at times they spend a lot of time together and it is only normal that they might begin to have sexual feelings towards each other , the <phrase>white</phrase> woman never considers protée or the existence of his feelings . a good example of this thoughtlessness is when she has protée <phrase>lace</phrase> up her dress and it 's obvious that he is very sexually frustrated by this . apart from this relationship , while almost all the whites are completely oblivious to the fact that the africans are people , a few go so far as to verbally abuse and treat them like garbage . also interesting is the relationship between protée and the little girl ( who is the one who is grown at the beginning and end of the <phrase>film</phrase> ) . while they are very close , at times he 's more like a plaything or pet and the girl never plays with <phrase>native</phrase> children . there is one bizarre <phrase>white</phrase> character who seems , at times , to regard the blacks better but unfortunately his character is very inconsistent and confusing . one moment , he 's doing hard work along side the blacks or eating with them ( something the other whites would never have done ) and the next he 's trying to beat up protée ! i could only guess as to what motivated him -- perhaps he was just a <phrase>jerk</phrase> , or was crazy or perhaps was a <phrase>communist</phrase> agitator trying to stir up the blacks against the whites ( who knows ! ) . in fact , other than a few good scenes , this character seems pretty much wasted . while i really enjoyed the insight this <phrase>movie</phrase> gave , i wish it had instead been more than just a few snippets of this world through the perspective of a child during one small <phrase>period</phrase> of her <phrase>life</phrase> . the context and what happened to rid the <phrase>country</phrase> of <phrase>colonialism</phrase> is never addressed and the <phrase>film</phrase> left me wanting more . the <phrase>film</phrase> appeared to begin in the early 1980s ( since she 's wearing a <phrase>walkman</phrase>-style headset ) and when the <phrase>film</phrase> went back in time , it seems that it was set about 1960 ( more or less ) , but there was never any mention of the 1950s <phrase>anti</phrase>-<phrase>colonialism</phrase> <phrase>violence</phrase> or <phrase>independence</phrase> for the nation in the early 1960s . i am guessing that some of this confusion might be that the makers of the <phrase>film</phrase> screwed up and should have made the beginning of the <phrase>film</phrase> earlier ( such as the 1970s ) and had the lady think back to her <phrase>life</phrase> there in the early 1950s -- before the <phrase>country</phrase> experienced <phrase>political</phrase> change . apart from the missing context and a confusion over time periods , using the prologue and epilogue that showed her as an adult traveling the <phrase>country</phrase> was a good idea . and i also appreciated the ending , as it was a pleasant surprise when you find out more about the <phrase>nice</phrase> man who offers her a ride . but overall , it just feels like something is missing -- there just is n't any sort of resolution or message other than showing that <phrase>colonialism</phrase> is thoughtless and cruel .
there is no <phrase>suspense</phrase> in this serial ! when one episode ends the acting is so shoddy , the effects are so poor and the script is so awful that the last thing on your mind is how <phrase>batman</phrase> and robin will save the day . no , in fact , the last thing on your mind is watching the next episode ! this show is so boring that i ca n't see how it ever got made , let alone released on <phrase>dvd</phrase> ! obviously the effects are not up to par with contemporary <phrase>batman</phrase> <phrase>films</phrase> , but even the script is awful . an incoherent <phrase>babbling</phrase> mess about some evil <phrase>professor</phrase> and a ray gun or something like that , i am not quite sure , because it is too awful to follow . <phrase>watch</phrase> the 60s version , or the 90 's versions , or even <phrase>batman</phrase> begins , just anything over this version !
this is a <phrase>film</phrase> that belongs firmly to the 50 's . very surprising that <phrase>american</phrase> <phrase>film</phrase> institute has chosen this one for one for the best 100 <phrase>american</phrase> movies of all-time . i have seen practically all of the movies on that list , and this one is by far the most disappointing one of those . <phrase>musical</phrase> numbers ( and there many , many of them ) are very overlong and boring , and have absolute no connection with the story . the end of the <phrase>movie</phrase> has horribly over-<phrase>long</phrase> <phrase>ballet</phrase> sequency , which naturally has no real relation to the story of the <phrase>movie</phrase> . it must be admitted , that it is very well made , the <phrase>music</phrase> is <phrase>ok</phrase> , and the dancing done with the highest <phrase>professional</phrase> standard - but there is no real reason why the <phrase>sequence</phrase> is included in the <phrase>movie</phrase> . the <phrase>main character</phrase> of the <phrase>movie</phrase> is extremely childlish and unlikeable and behaves in unpolite way . his mental age is about 14 . if you want to see a good <phrase>musical</phrase> made on the <phrase>``</phrase> <phrase>golden age</phrase> '' of musicals , go and see <phrase>``</phrase> <phrase>singing</phrase> in the <phrase>rain</phrase> '' .
savaged when it came out , this <phrase>film</phrase> now looks handsome and sounds great . a feast of intelligent thoughtful acting , from gielgud , <phrase>kenneth haigh</phrase> , <phrase>harry andrews</phrase> and especially <phrase>anton walbrook</phrase> , and a moving central performance from the beautiful and incredibly young <phrase>jean seberg</phrase> . preminger does n't jump around and show off- his <phrase>long</phrase> slow takes encourage you to listen and reflect , and <phrase>graham greene</phrase> 's script condenses shaw without sacrificing complexity.the piece has the look of a made for <phrase>tv</phrase> <phrase>movie</phrase> , and is certainly studio bound but none the worse for that . too many contemporary movies on 'historical ' themes can not resist dumbing down . what would <phrase>mel gibson</phrase> have made of the maid ? many drooling shots of her on the rack probably , then crisping up on the bbq as the <phrase>flames</phrase> take hold . preminger does none of this . the burning is shown mainly through a guilt-stricken <phrase>reaction</phrase> . there are a few weak performances , but not enough to cause any serious damage . i <phrase>caught</phrase> this <phrase>movie</phrase> on <phrase>tv</phrase> and was not expecting to <phrase>watch</phrase> it through , but i was gripped . in our age of <phrase>religious fundamentalism</phrase> and sacrifice , joan 's story has unexpected <phrase>resonance</phrase> .
demonicus rocked , you guys need to understand how hard it rocked , unfortunately , the words needed to explain the extent of the rocking have not been discovered . for a tiny idea , <phrase>pop</phrase> like 50 <phrase>hits</phrase> of <phrase>e</phrase> , <phrase>watch</phrase> <phrase>death</phrase> <phrase>factory</phrase> while on the phone with <phrase>jesus</phrase> , wait , <phrase>jesus</phrase> is on call waiting , you 're having <phrase>phone sex</phrase> with will smith on the primary line . seriously , that <phrase>movie</phrase> ... so good . you need to <phrase>watch</phrase> it at least <phrase>a 4</phrase> times to catch all the subtleties ... well , not so much subtleties as much as it takes the length of the <phrase>movie</phrase> , times 4 in <phrase>order</phrase> to ponder why the people at full <phrase>moon</phrase> are allowed to a , <phrase>live</phrase> , and b , reproduce . what is our world coming to ?
i rated <phrase>basic</phrase> instinct 2 <phrase>high</phrase> , yet that <phrase>movie</phrase> got less than <phrase>a 4</phrase> rating . this <phrase>film</phrase> only got <phrase>a 4</phrase> from me , but it has 7.3 from over 600 people . i do n't see a reason why they like this <phrase>film</phrase> so much . this <phrase>film</phrase> is boring , because it hardly ever <phrase>leaves</phrase> those rooms in that broken big <phrase>house</phrase> . and it only has a total of 5 people in this <phrase>film</phrase> . it is almost two hours <phrase>long</phrase> which is totally unnecessary . many of dialogues are slow and meaningless . the <phrase>film</phrase> tone is also dark <phrase>blue</phrase> which is depressing to <phrase>watch</phrase> . the <phrase>film</phrase> can just be shorten to a few sentences . this <phrase>film</phrase> reminds me of <phrase>``</phrase> three times '' <phrase>directed</phrase> by <phrase>hou hsiao hsien</phrase> , that one is equally boring , the dialogues are also equally boring . it also has a <phrase>high</phrase> rating ! i had to stop watching that one after the first story finished . this <phrase>film</phrase> lacks of passion or excitement .
<phrase>``</phrase> emma '' was a product of what might be called by the first great <phrase>jane austen</phrase> cycle of the mid-nineties , and it was recently shown on <phrase>british</phrase> <phrase>television</phrase> , doubtless because of the interest in the <phrase>author</phrase> created by the second great <phrase>jane austen</phrase> cycle which started with <phrase>``</phrase> <phrase>pride and prejudice</phrase> '' two <phrase>years ago</phrase> . we currently have in the cinemas the <phrase>austen</phrase> <phrase>biopic</phrase> <phrase>``</phrase> becoming jane '' , and <phrase>itv</phrase> have recently <phrase>produced</phrase> three <phrase>tv</phrase> movies based on <phrase>austen</phrase> <phrase>novels</phrase> . these include <phrase>``</phrase> <phrase>northanger abbey</phrase> '' , the only one of the six <phrase>major</phrase> <phrase>novels</phrase> not to have been filmed previously , so the cycle should now be complete . no doubt , however , there will be more to come in the near future . ( there is , after all , her juvenile <phrase>``</phrase> <phrase>love</phrase> and freindship '' ( sic ) , the <phrase>short</phrase> <phrase>novella</phrase> <phrase>``</phrase> lady susan '' , and someone , somewhere , has doubtless supplied endings to her two unfinished fragments <phrase>``</phrase> the watsons '' and <phrase>``</phrase> sanditon '' . then there are all those <phrase>austen</phrase> sequels churned out by modern writers ) . the <phrase>main character</phrase> is emma woodhouse , a <phrase>young lady</phrase> from an aristocratic <phrase>family</phrase> in regency <phrase>england</phrase> . ( not , as some reviewers have assumed , <phrase>victorian england</phrase>- <phrase>austen</phrase> died before <phrase>queen victoria</phrase> was even born ) . emma is , financially , considerably better off than most <phrase>austen</phrase> heroines such as elizabeth bennett or fanny price , and has no need to find herself a wealthy husband . instead , her main preoccupation seems to be finding husbands for her <phrase>friends</phrase> . she persuades her friend harriet to turn down a proposal of <phrase>marriage</phrase> from a young <phrase>farmer</phrase> , <phrase>robert martin</phrase> , believing that harriet should be setting her sights on the ambitious clergyman mr <phrase>elton</phrase> . this scheme goes disastrously wrong , however , as <phrase>elton</phrase> has no interest in harriet , but has fallen in <phrase>love</phrase> with emma herself . the speed with which emma rejects his proposal makes one wonder just why she was so keen to match her friend with a man she regards ( with good reason ) as an unsuitable <phrase>marriage</phrase> partner for herself . this being a <phrase>jane austen</phrase> plot , emma turns out to be less of a committed <phrase>spinster</phrase> than she seems , and she too finds herself falling in <phrase>love</phrase> , leading to further complications . emma always insists that she will not marry without affection , and when she does find a partner , the handsome mr knightley , we feel that this will indeed be an affectionate <phrase>marriage</phrase> . it does not , however , seem likely to be a very passionate one ( unlike , say , that of elizabeth bennett and <phrase>mr darcy</phrase> ) . knightley , who is sixteen years older than emma ( she is 21 , he 37 ) , and related to her by <phrase>marriage</phrase> , is more like a <phrase>father-figure</phrase> than a lover . much more of a <phrase>father-figure</phrase> , in fact , than her actual father , a querulous and selfish old hypochondriac who seems more like her grandfather . when emma is rude to her unbearably garrulous and tedious friend miss bates , it is knightley who chides her for her lack of manners . ( his <phrase>surname</phrase> is probably meant to indicate his gentlemanly <phrase>nature</phrase>- nineteenth-century gentlemen liked to think of themselves as the modern equivalent of <phrase>mediaeval</phrase> knights with their elaborate codes of <phrase>chivalry</phrase> ) . both <phrase>gwyneth paltrow</phrase> and <phrase>jeremy northam</phrase> <phrase>play</phrase> their parts very well , but this is not really one of the great screen romances . of the other characters , i liked juliet stephenson 's vulgar mrs <phrase>elton</phrase> and <phrase>toni collette</phrase> 's harriet . i know that in the novel harriet was a naïve young teenager , whereas here she is more like the character collette played in <phrase>``</phrase> muriel 's <phrase>wedding</phrase> '' - a gauche , slightly overweight twentysomething , <phrase>fretting</phrase> about her chances of finding a man . nevertheless , i felt that this characterisation worked well in the context of the <phrase>film</phrase> and did not detract from <phrase>austen</phrase> 's themes . <phrase>``</phrase> emma '' is one of <phrase>austen</phrase> 's more <phrase>light</phrase>-hearted works , without the darker overtones of <phrase>``</phrase> <phrase>mansfield park</phrase> '' or even <phrase>``</phrase> <phrase>pride and prejudice</phrase> '' , and this is reflected on screen . we see a world of beauty and grace , full of stately homes and elegant costumes and fine manners . apart from the ruffianly <phrase>gypsies</phrase> , who make a very brief appearance , the only <phrase>``</phrase> poor '' people we see are mrs bates and her daughter , and , as they <phrase>live</phrase> in the sort of picturesque <phrase>rose</phrase>-strewn thatched cottage which today would change hands for over £500,000 , we can be sure that their <phrase>poverty</phrase> is relative , not absolute . in emma 's world , <phrase>poverty</phrase> is defined as not having your own <phrase>stately home</phrase> . this is , of course , not a <phrase>comprehensive</phrase> picture of early nineteenth-century <phrase>life</phrase> , but nobody has ever claimed <phrase>austen</phrase> as the regency equivalent of a <phrase>kitchen-sink</phrase> realist . sophisticated <phrase>romantic comedy</phrase> , combined with a keen eye for analysing <phrase>human</phrase> character , was more in her line . i would not rate this <phrase>film</phrase> quite as highly as the 1994 <phrase>``</phrase> sense and sensibility '' or the recent <phrase>``</phrase> <phrase>pride and prejudice</phrase> '' - it tends to drag a <phrase>bit</phrase> in the middle , although it has a strong beginning and strong ending- but it is , in the main , a highly enjoyable <phrase>austen</phrase> adaptation . 7/10
i <phrase>love</phrase> bad movies . not only , because they often are as entertaining as 'really ' 'good ' <phrase>films</phrase> ( like <phrase>pirates</phrase> of the <phrase>caribbean</phrase> series and other <phrase>hollywood</phrase> <phrase>pathos</phrase> ) , but they often are far better than those <phrase>films</phrase> . and that 's the reason why i <phrase>love</phrase> <phrase>italian</phrase> rip off cinema of 1970s and 1980s . and that 's the reason why i especially <phrase>love</phrase> this <phrase>movie</phrase> , the barbarians & the <phrase>company</phrase> . <phrase>director</phrase> <phrase>ruggero deodato</phrase> has made some actually very good movies , like <phrase>house</phrase> on the edge of the <phrase>park</phrase> , and also his <phrase>atlantis</phrase> interceptors and <phrase>live</phrase> like a cop , die like a man are enjoyable <phrase>action</phrase> movies . but this is really bad . the barbarians is so idiotic <phrase>movie</phrase> . peter and <phrase>david</phrase> paul as the <phrase>barbarian</phrase> brothers kutchek and <phrase>gore</phrase> are very funny , because of their lack of charisma and <phrase>acting skills</phrase> . but if they ca n't <phrase>act</phrase> , they yell and scream every time they do something important . in one scene people try to hang the <phrase>barbarian</phrase> brothers , and they escape very extraordinary way . bad acting , bad <phrase>special effects</phrase> , very stupid story , bad direction , actually everything is bad in this <phrase>movie</phrase> . i ca n't describe how much i laughed when i watched this first time . the barbarians & the <phrase>company</phrase> is camp classic everybody should see once . if you thought <phrase>plan 9</phrase> from <phrase>outer space</phrase> is fun camp , this will be a real killer .
i remember seeing this one when i was seven or eight . i must have found the characters round , because they left a impression in my mind that lasted for a <phrase>long</phrase> time after the end of the <phrase>movie</phrase> . and the ending , now that 's sad , well ... for <phrase>a 7</phrase>-8 year old kid . i had the opportunity of seeing this <phrase>movie</phrase> again lately , and found that the plot was too simple , the character , two-dimensional ... i guess it 's the kind of <phrase>movie</phrase> that you can only with the innocence of a young child ... pity ... i recommend this one for all you parents with small kids ... ( i saw it in its original <phrase>french</phrase> version , so i can not tell you whether the <phrase>translation</phrase> is good or not . )
i am not sure who is writing these glowing reviews for this <phrase>movie</phrase> but trust me it stkinks . i have seen hundreds of <phrase>horror films</phrase> and <phrase>slasher</phrase> flicks and this one is lame it is only about 80min <phrase>long</phrase> and believe me that is all i could take . plot is terrible , acting is even worse . and there is no development at all . even the <phrase>david</phrase> <phrase>cocteau</phrase> <phrase>films</phrase> are better than this . run away from <phrase>jigsaw</phrase> . i expected to hate the acting , which can be forgiven in <phrase>direct to video</phrase> movies , if the plot is good . this had no scares , very little <phrase>gore</phrase> , and a truly unattractive cast . i watched this with three other <phrase>friends</phrase> who i hope are still talking to me ! they wanted me to fling the disc out the window . i can not believe anyone could have given this <phrase>tripe</phrase> a good review .
a must see <phrase>film</phrase> with great dialogues , great <phrase>music</phrase> , great acting and a superb <phrase>atmosphere</phrase> . in the <phrase>film</phrase> you will follow 8 people for one day in the <phrase>city</phrase> of <phrase>antwerp</phrase> , they are all individuals and sometimes plain weird ( that 's how i <phrase>love</phrase> them ! ) . i 'm not going to say anything else , just go see and enjoy it .
this <phrase>movie</phrase> surely has one of the strangest themes in <phrase>history</phrase> -- right up there with <phrase>ed wood</phrase> 's impassioned defense of <phrase>cross-dressing</phrase> in <phrase>``</phrase> <phrase>glen or glenda</phrase> ? '' the subject : playing <phrase>bridge</phrase> . the <phrase>park</phrase> avenue set plays it ; the <phrase>bohemians</phrase> <phrase>play</phrase> it . the <phrase>russians</phrase> -- who speak very questionable <phrase>``</phrase> <phrase>russian</phrase> '' and have most unconvincing accents when they <phrase>speak english</phrase> -- <phrase>play</phrase> it at the <phrase>restaurant</phrase> where they work . if one is n't interested in <phrase>bridge</phrase> , one -- even despite the great cast -- is n't likely to be much interested in this bizarre <phrase>movie</phrase> . <phrase>loretta young</phrase> and <phrase>paul lukas</phrase> are fine . ( well -- <phrase>frank mchugh</phrase> is an unlikely <phrase>ghost</phrase> <phrase>writer</phrase> -- as <phrase>lukas</phrase> is an unlikely <phrase>russian</phrase> . ) but they are all sunk by the fetishistic script .
i first heard of this <phrase>movie</phrase> after purchasing the 1976 flick <phrase>``</phrase> snuff '' . i was told that <phrase>devil</phrase> 's experiment was much better so naturally i went ahead and ordered the <phrase>guinea pig</phrase> <phrase>box set</phrase> . i was really interested to hear that <phrase>charlie sheen</phrase> had come out trying to ban either this <phrase>movie</phrase> or the second one , so my interest was peaked . <phrase>devil</phrase> 's experiment is a <phrase>short film</phrase> with no story , no <phrase>character development</phrase> . just 3 men torturing a woman for about 45 minutes . they <phrase>torture</phrase> her in various ways like beating her , spinning her in circles over and over again then forcing her to drink <phrase>alcohol</phrase> , forcing her to listen to hi-<phrase>pitched</phrase> noise for 24 hours , smash her hand with a <phrase>mallet</phrase> , burning and putting <phrase>maggots</phrase> on the burns , throwing guts at her , and ultimately shoving a sharp needle through her eye . i must say that a lot of this <phrase>movie</phrase> was fake , like the beating scenes . but then , some of it was actually well done as far as grossing you out . the scenes in which the woman is being spun around in circles was making me <phrase>dizzy</phrase> watching it . or the scene in which she is forced to listen to sharp noise for 24 hours is painful to think about . the worst is the eye scene . i did n't shutter when watching it but simply thought <phrase>``</phrase> damn , that looks pretty good for such a <phrase>low budget</phrase> <phrase>movie</phrase> '' . i did enjoy the flick but i do n't know if i can really recommend this unless you have seen most of what the <phrase>horror genre</phrase> has to offer . 7/10
oh my <phrase>god</phrase> , what a horrible <phrase>film</phrase> . the <phrase>film</phrase> has all the right people involved , unfortunately it is not <phrase>worth watching</phrase> . i saw it for <phrase>free</phrase> at my <phrase>local library</phrase> . if i had paid to <phrase>watch</phrase> this i would be even more upset . this <phrase>film</phrase> is unwatchable . how could tarintino be involved with such a <phrase>slow paced</phrase> , unexciting <phrase>film</phrase> . no wonder it did n't get much distribution , every one involved must have been ashamed . i can make a better <phrase>film</phrase> with a dated <phrase>camcorder</phrase> and my big toe . its beyond boring , i really hated it . tarintino just <phrase>lost</phrase> some standing in my eyes . this must be some kind of sick joke . do n't bother with this <phrase>film</phrase> . if some one even hints you should <phrase>watch</phrase> it , kill them .
why should you <phrase>watch</phrase> this ? there are certainly no reasons why you should n't <phrase>watch</phrase> it ! superbly and amusingly <phrase>directed</phrase> by <phrase>albert and david maysles</phrase> , <phrase>grey gardens</phrase> was <phrase>originally intended</phrase> to be a <phrase>film</phrase> on the <phrase>gentrification</phrase> of east hampton , but it turned out to the brothers that it would be more interesting to produce a study on the eccentric <phrase>life</phrase> of the two edith bouvier beales , the aunt and cousin of <phrase>jacqueline kennedy onassis</phrase> . their <phrase>life</phrase> was certainly an amusing one ( edith spent most of her day in bed <phrase>singing</phrase> <phrase>operas</phrase> , edie performing pirouettes and majorette dances with their many cats , one was named ted z. <phrase>kennedy</phrase> ) the <phrase>film</phrase> is interesting because it is both funny and sad - edith died shortly after the <phrase>film</phrase> was released ( in february 1977 ) aged 82 after experiencing some of the fame that she and edie received after the <phrase>film</phrase> ( she danced and sang in a <phrase>nightclub</phrase> edie beale <phrase>jr</phrase> was born in 1925 and is still living in <phrase>miami</phrase> beach.this <phrase>film</phrase> is both engaging and spellbounding .
although it really is n't such a terribly <phrase>movie</phrase> ( especially considering it was made directly for <phrase>tv</phrase>-distribution ) , it 'll be very difficult to point out one <phrase>aspect</phrase> in <phrase>``</phrase> bloodsuckers '' that is actually original or refreshing . <phrase>vampires</phrase> in space is n't exactly a new formula , and even after so many movies dealing with these monsters in this particular setting , still no one seems to realize it 's an <phrase>incredibly stupid</phrase> premise that ca n't possibly result in a <phrase>halfway decent</phrase> <phrase>horror movie</phrase> . <phrase>``</phrase> bloodsuckers '' even goes one step further and shamelessly imitates every imaginable <phrase>motion picture</phrase> that either revolves on <phrase>vampires</phrase> and intergalactic warfare . the plot and characters are mainly <phrase>stolen</phrase> directly from <phrase>john carpenter</phrase> 's <phrase>``</phrase> ghosts of <phrase>mars</phrase> '' and <phrase>james cameron</phrase> 's <phrase>``</phrase> aliens '' , as a crew of futuristic <phrase>vampire</phrase> hunters are crusading through space and regularly holding to eliminate a mutated <phrase>species</phrase> that peculiarly named themselves after notorious <phrase>horror</phrase> <phrase>icons</phrase> , like the voorhees and the leatherfaces . the good guys are a bunch of pathetic <phrase>stereotypes</phrase> , constantly dealing with clichéd issues and endlessly arguing about dreadfully unimportant matters . <phrase>captain</phrase> damian is the unpopular rookie , who 'll really have to prove his <phrase>leadership</phrase> capabilities now after being more or less responsible for the <phrase>death</phrase> of the previous ( and far more loved ) <phrase>captain</phrase> <phrase>churchill</phrase> . the other annoying characters include a typical <phrase>cowboy</phrase>-style and trigger happy macho <phrase>pilot</phrase> , a tough female warrior with more balls than any of the males on board ( she 's of <phrase>asian</phrase> descent , like the girl in <phrase>``</phrase> aliens '' was <phrase>latino</phrase> ) and the <phrase>army</phrase> 's most valuable secret <phrase>weapon</phrase> : a blade-girl ! quintana is a beautiful and deadly <phrase>vampire</phrase> who chose the side of humans . she can spot enemies when they 're still <phrase>light</phrase>-years away and she can also do wickedly sexy things with someone 's wet dreams . they eventually all learn to work as a team when forced to face the ultimate <phrase>vampire</phrase>-meanie : <phrase>michael ironside</phrase> ( in yet another downgrading role ) . <phrase>``</phrase> bloodsuckers '' is an irredeemably stupid <phrase>film</phrase> , but it manages to entertain as <phrase>long</phrase> as it features gory killings , infantile dialogs and ott make-up effects . it only gets intolerably boring when the frustrated soldiers blame the <phrase>captain</phrase> for the umpteenth time and bla bla bla . this <phrase>film</phrase> is a non-stop series of lame <phrase>clichés</phrase> and uncreative ideas , but at least it 's watchable .
this sad little <phrase>film</phrase> <phrase>bears</phrase> little similarity to the 1971 <phrase>broadway</phrase> revival that was such a 'nostalgic ' hit . keep in mind that when <phrase>burt shevelove</phrase> <phrase>directed</phrase> that revival , he rewrote the <phrase>book</phrase> extensively . i have a feeling that this <phrase>screenwriter</phrase> wrought as much of a change from the original 1925 version as well . i played the 'innocent philanderer ' <phrase>jimmy smith</phrase> on-stage in 1974 , and thought this $ 1 <phrase>dvd</phrase> would bring back memories . not a chance . even the anticipated delight of seeing <phrase>``</phrase> topper '' <phrase>roland young</phrase> <phrase>play</phrase> 'my ' part was a <phrase>major</phrase> disappointment . three songs from the <phrase>play</phrase> remain , and are done very poorly . even the classic <phrase>duet</phrase> , <phrase>``</phrase> <phrase>tea</phrase> for two '' , is done as a virtual solo . the many <phrase>familiar faces</phrase> in this 1940 fiasco do not do themselves proud at all , and the <phrase>star</phrase> , <phrase>anna neagle</phrase> , just embarrasses herself . when i feel gypped by spending a dollar , i know the <phrase>film</phrase> must be bad . another commentator mentioned the doris day version , which is actually called <phrase>``</phrase> <phrase>tea</phrase> for two '' and is about doing the <phrase>stage play</phrase> ( the original , of course ) , so those who are seeking the true <phrase>``</phrase> no no nanette '' might find a more recognizable version there .
when i first saw this <phrase>film</phrase> , in <phrase>london</phrase> , in 1958 , i was bowled over . i had never seen a <phrase>film</phrase> like this before . it had a strange , <phrase>hypnotic</phrase> effect , quite unlike the <phrase>films</phrase> that i had seen previously and it left a lasting impact . i believe that odile versios & <phrase>marina</phrase> vlady are sisters , if not <phrase>twins</phrase> . certainly the interaction is amazing in its power to influence the viewer . if this has been converted to <phrase>dvd</phrase> - in <phrase>region</phrase> 2 format - and in the original <phrase>french language</phrase> , i would <phrase>love</phrase> to hear about it & where it can be purchased .
this would 've been a * great * <phrase>silent film</phrase> . the acting really is good , at least in a look <phrase>ma</phrase> , i 'm doing really big acting ! sort of way . everything is huge . every line is profound ! every scene is shattered by <phrase>human</phrase> <phrase>tragedy</phrase> ! mostly , i felt like gagging . yet , like any <phrase>train</phrase> wreck , i could n't tear my eyes away . this dialogue might 've worked on the stage , although i doubt it . on the screen , it was cluttered , haphazard , hackneyed and pretty much every other stereotypical negative <phrase>adjective</phrase> you can come up with to describe a really bad dramatic work . if you enjoy your <phrase>melodrama</phrase> in huge , heaping doses , you * might * enjoy the <phrase>movie</phrase> . be prepared to wait , however . for all that <phrase>melodrama</phrase> , this thing sure plods along at its own pace . this script must 've sounded a lot different when the <phrase>actors</phrase> involved were <phrase>reading</phrase> it to themselves . it simply does n't work once they get around to delivering it in front of the <phrase>camera</phrase> . <phrase>imdb</phrase> does us a great disservice , at times , when it uses its <phrase>goofy</phrase> computer-controlled <phrase>``</phrase> weighted score '' . curse of the starving class deserves less than a 1 . <phrase>character-driven</phrase> <phrase>fiction</phrase> is great , but when you develop your characters by simply pushing them through hoops with no plausible explanation for their maturation or <phrase>evolution</phrase> , it is n't <phrase>character development</phrase> ! your characters must have a <phrase>motivation</phrase> . being drunk for a while and waking up in a field is * not * <phrase>character development</phrase> . that 's a plot contrivance . stay away from this <phrase>movie</phrase> . or at the very least , <phrase>watch</phrase> it muted . perhaps you 'll get some <phrase>amusement</phrase> from all the arm-waving the characters do . oh , and word to the wise -- to prove that this is truly an artsy <phrase>film</phrase> , you see <phrase>james woods</phrase> in all his dangly male <phrase>``</phrase> look-at-me , i'm-the-figurative-and-literal-representation-of-the-naked-vulnerability-of- man '' glory . do n't say you were n't warned .
nobody truly understands the <phrase>logic</phrase> behind the numbering of <phrase>italian</phrase> <phrase>zombie</phrase>-flicks , but  honestly  why would we bother ? every <phrase>single</phrase> <phrase>film</phrase> in the zombi- '' series '' delivers great fun , nasty <phrase>gore</phrase> and gratuitous shocks and <phrase>``</phrase> <phrase>zombi 3</phrase> '' is no exception to this , despite all the <phrase>production</phrase> difficulties that occurred whilst <phrase>shooting</phrase> . this <phrase>film</phrase> began as an interesting <phrase>lucio fulci</phrase> project , who had to elaborate further on his <phrase>``</phrase> <phrase>zombi 2</phrase> '' success , but it ended up being a typical <phrase>bruno mattei</phrase> product with more flaws and <phrase>stolen</phrase> ideas from previous <phrase>films</phrase> . the <phrase>screenplay</phrase> is hopelessly inept and ignores all forms of continuity , every ingenious idea from george a. romero 's <phrase>``</phrase> night of the <phrase>living dead</phrase> '' and <phrase>``</phrase> the crazies '' is shamelessly repeated here and the acting performances are truly miserable and painful to look at . yet all this did n't upset me for one moment because the sublime over-the-top <phrase>gore</phrase> compensates for everything ! on a <phrase>secret army</phrase> base at the phillipines , scientists completed the <phrase>bacterial</phrase> warfare <phrase>virus</phrase> <phrase>``</phrase> <phrase>death</phrase> one '' and prepare it for <phrase>transport</phrase> . after a failing attempt to steal the <phrase>virus</phrase> , the infected corpse of a <phrase>terrorist</phrase> is cremated and the <phrase>zombie</phrase>-ashes contaminate the entire <phrase>population</phrase> of a nearby <phrase>tourist</phrase> <phrase>village</phrase> . the last group of survivors has to battle hyperactive and inhumanly strong <phrase>zombies</phrase> as well as soldiers in <phrase>white</phrase> overalls that received instructions to kill everything that moves in the contaminated <phrase>area</phrase> . this <phrase>movie</phrase> is comparable to <phrase>umberto lenzi</phrase> 's <phrase>``</phrase> nightmare <phrase>city</phrase> '' . truly bad ... but incredibly entertaining with <phrase>fast-paced</phrase> <phrase>action</phrase> sequences and several very creative <phrase>zombie</phrase>-madness situations . the <phrase>undead</phrase> <phrase>birds</phrase> were original , for example , and the whole <phrase>zombie</phrase> birth <phrase>sequence</phrase> at the deserted <phrase>hospital</phrase> was <phrase>pretty cool</phrase> as well . the infamous flying head scene is not nearly as awful as it 's made up to be and it belongs perfectly in this cheesy and thoroughly pleasant <phrase>italian</phrase> <phrase>zombie</phrase> flick . recommended to the fans ; do n't mind the <phrase>negative reviews</phrase> .
<phrase>``</phrase> the blob '' qualifies as a <phrase>cult</phrase> <phrase>sci-fi</phrase> <phrase>film</phrase> not only because it <phrase>launched</phrase> 27-year old <phrase>steve mcqueen</phrase> on a trajectory to superstardom , but also because it exploited the popular themes both of <phrase>alien invasion</phrase> and teenage <phrase>delinquency</phrase> that were inseparable in the 1950s . interestingly , nobody in the <phrase>kay linaker</phrase> & <phrase>theodore</phrase> simonson <phrase>screenplay</phrase> ever refers to the amorphous , scarlet-<phrase>red</phrase> <phrase>protoplasm</phrase> that plummeted to <phrase>earth</phrase> in a meteor and menaced everybody in the <phrase>small town</phrase> of <phrase>downingtown pennsylvania</phrase> on a <phrase>friday night</phrase> as <phrase>``</phrase> the blob . '' <phrase>steve mcqueen</phrase> won the role of josh randall , the old west <phrase>bounty hunter</phrase> in <phrase>``</phrase> wanted : <phrase>dead or alive</phrase> , '' after <phrase>producer</phrase> <phrase>dick powell</phrase> saw this <phrase>paramount</phrase> pictures ' release . meanwhile <phrase>mcqueen</phrase> 's attractive girlfriend aneta corsaut went on to <phrase>star</phrase> opposite <phrase>andy griffith</phrase> in <phrase>``</phrase> the <phrase>andy griffith</phrase> show '' as <phrase>sheriff</phrase> taylor 's <phrase>school</phrase> <phrase>teacher</phrase> girlfriend helen crump . of course , neither <phrase>mcqueen</phrase> nor corsaut were teenagers , but then rarely did actual teenagers <phrase>play</phrase> actual teenagers . <phrase>director</phrase> irvin s. yeaworth , <phrase>jr</phrase>. , made his <phrase>directorial debut</phrase> with <phrase>``</phrase> the blob . '' linaker & simonson 's <phrase>screenplay</phrase> synthesized four genres : first , the <phrase>alien invasion</phrase> ; second , teenage <phrase>delinquency</phrase> ; third , a <phrase>murder</phrase> <phrase>mystery</phrase> , and fourth ; a <phrase>horror</phrase> <phrase>chiller</phrase> . moreover , while the gelatinous substance assumes various shapes , it remains largely anonymous . in other words , the <phrase>eponymous</phrase> <phrase>jell-o</phrase> neither talks nor communicates by <phrase>telepathy</phrase> . instead , it kills without a qualm and discriminates against nobody . the tone of <phrase>``</phrase> the blob '' is fairly serious in spite of its somewhat campy <phrase>nature</phrase> . as the filmmakers point out on the criterion <phrase>dvd</phrase> release of <phrase>``</phrase> the blob , '' the <phrase>movie</phrase> opens uncharacteristically for a <phrase>sci-fi</phrase> <phrase>horror</phrase> <phrase>thriller</phrase> with our <phrase>hero</phrase> and heroine in a remote rural locale making out and kissing . jane ( anita corsaut ) and steve ( <phrase>steve mcqueen</phrase> ) see a large meteor fall to the <phrase>earth</phrase> and drive off to find it . meanwhile , an old man finds the meteor and prods it with a stick . the meteor cracks open and a slimy bunch of goop clings to the stick . when the old timer ( <phrase>olin howland</phrase> of <phrase>``</phrase> the paleface '' ) gets a closer look at it , the goop attaches itself to his hand . the old guy <phrase>runs</phrase> screaming from the <phrase>crater</phrase> and steve nearly <phrase>hits</phrase> him with his jalopy . steve and jane pick the guy up and take him to see dr. hallen in <phrase>town</phrase> . hallen is poised to leave <phrase>town</phrase> for a <phrase>medical</phrase> conference when steve and jane bring the old guy to his office . hallen <phrase>phones</phrase> his <phrase>nurse</phrase> to return since he may need to perform an <phrase>amputation</phrase> . of course , hallen has never seen anything like the substance on the man 's <phrase>forearm</phrase> . hallen sends steve and jane to find out what happened . our heroes run into another group of teenagers that ridicule steve 's fast driving . steve fools him into a reverse drive <phrase>race</phrase> , but the local <phrase>police</phrase> chief dave ( earl rowe ) lets him off the hook . steve and the teenagers visit the site of the <phrase>meteor crater</phrase> and find the warm remains of the meteor . after they visit the old man 's <phrase>house</phrase> and rescue a <phrase>dog</phrase> , the teenagers <phrase>split</phrase> for a spooky <phrase>late night</phrase> <phrase>movie</phrase> while steve and jane return to dr. hallen 's office . during the interim , the blob has entirely absorbed the old geezer , killed hallen 's <phrase>nurse</phrase> and attacked the doctor . neither <phrase>acid</phrase> thrown on the <phrase>protoplasm</phrase> nor hallen 's <phrase>shotgun</phrase> have any effect on the blob . steve catches a glimpse of the blob absorbing hallen . when steve and jane go to the <phrase>police</phrase> <phrase>department</phrase> to <phrase>report</phrase> the incident , dave is frankly incredulous , while <phrase>sergeant</phrase> bert ( john benson ) believes that it is a prank . bert has an <phrase>axe</phrase> to grind with teenagers because his wife died when one struck her <phrase>car</phrase> . steve and jane take them to hallen 's office , but they can find neither hide nor <phrase>hair</phrase> of anybody , but dave admits that the office has been vandalized . against sgt . bert 's advice , dave turns the teens over to their respective parents . no sooner have steve and jane fooled their folks into believing that they are snugly asleep in bed than they <phrase>venture</phrase> out again . they drive into <phrase>town</phrase> and spot the old man 's <phrase>dog</phrase> that got away from them in front of a <phrase>supermarket</phrase> . when they go to retrieve the mutt , steve steps in front of the electric eye door of the <phrase>grocery store</phrase> and it opens . they find nobody inside , but they encounter the blob . steve and jane take refuge in a freezer and the blob does n't attack them . later , after they escape , steve persuades the teenagers that challenged him in a street <phrase>race</phrase> to alert the authorities because he is supposed to be home in bed . <phrase>police</phrase> chief dave and the fire <phrase>department</phrase> arrive at the <phrase>supermarket</phrase> . steve tries to convince dave that the blob is in the store . about that time , the blob kills the <phrase>theater</phrase> <phrase>projectionist</phrase> and attacks the moviegoers . suddenly , a <phrase>horde</phrase> of people exit the <phrase>theater</phrase> and dave believes steve . steve and jane <phrase>wind</phrase> up at a <phrase>lunch counter</phrase> that the blob attacks . the proprietor and our heroes hole up in the cellar and steve discovers that a fire extinguisher with its freezing contents forces the blob to back off . the authorities collect every fire extinguisher in <phrase>town</phrase> and manage to freeze the blob . the <phrase>pentagon</phrase> sends down a team to <phrase>transport</phrase> the blob to the <phrase>north pole</phrase> . as the remains of the blob drift down to the polar <phrase>ice</phrase> pack , the end credit appears with a ghostly giant <phrase>question mark</phrase> . <phrase>producer</phrase> james b. harris obtained <phrase>stock</phrase> <phrase>military</phrase> footage of a globe <phrase>master</phrase> <phrase>military</phrase> <phrase>transport</phrase> plane depositing the <phrase>parachute</phrase> and its <phrase>cargo</phrase> . <phrase>``</phrase> the blob '' proved to be a drive-in hit and <phrase>steve mcqueen</phrase> 's surge to stardom gave the <phrase>film</phrase> added <phrase>momentum</phrase> . unless you are a juvenile , this little <phrase>horror movie</phrase> is n't scary at all , but yeaworth and his scenarists create a sufficient amount of <phrase>paranoia</phrase> and sympathy for our heroes . they never show the blob actually assimilating its victims and leave this to your imagination , so <phrase>``</phrase> the blob '' is n't without a modicum of subtlety .
all of the people reviewing this <phrase>film</phrase> , and probably many <phrase>professional</phrase> <phrase>film</phrase> reviewers , just do n't get it . this <phrase>film</phrase> was made with matting sequences and <phrase>art</phrase> techniques quite like the works of the great <phrase>czech</phrase> <phrase>filmmaker</phrase> , <phrase>karel zeman</phrase> . if you want to know what i 'm talking about , i suggest you get any of zeman 's <phrase>films</phrase> , such as the fabulous world of <phrase>jules verne</phrase> , <phrase>baron</phrase> munchausen , journey to the beginning of time , or on the <phrase>comet</phrase> . if you are unable to locate a <phrase>film</phrase> , then read the reviews in amg . they will explain the processes used . if one were to look at zeman 's work and try to compare it to any of the other <phrase>sci/fi</phrase> <phrase>fantasy</phrase> <phrase>films</phrase> of the time , viewers probably would n't have gotten it then either . it is unfair to compare either of these filmmakers ' styles to the standard technologies of the day , because both zemen and hines <phrase>``</phrase> do not compute '' . they have a style that is unique to them and should be judged for their <phrase>creativity</phrase> only . if you look at this <phrase>film</phrase> from a perspective where you know that he intentionally tried to create a <phrase>pastiche</phrase> <phrase>collage</phrase> of mattes mixed with <phrase>live action</phrase> , you could easily come to the conclusion that he did a masterful job . it is n't easy making a bunch of computer cutouts flow . i thought that the creatures were also quite good , also considering how they were made . hines took a great gamble , and i think his <phrase>film</phrase> will not be fairly judged for years to come . someone promoting the <phrase>film</phrase> should have tipped the audience off as to what they would be seeing , rather than let them blindly go into the <phrase>theater</phrase> expecting the usual cg work . regarding the <phrase>actors</phrase> , i think hines also took a page from zemen 's <phrase>book</phrase> , in that many of zemen 's <phrase>actors</phrase> were somewhat expressionless at first , but became much more engaging as the <phrase>film</phrase> and <phrase>action</phrase> went on . it is totally refreshing to me to have this <phrase>movie</phrase> in my <phrase>library</phrase> . i will <phrase>watch</phrase> it for years to come , all three great hours of it .
<phrase>high school</phrase> <phrase>friends</phrase> andre kriegman and cal <phrase>gabriel</phrase> declare <phrase>war</phrase> on their classmates and plan a terrifying <phrase>assault</phrase> on their <phrase>high school</phrase> . as they begin the deadly <phrase>countdown</phrase> to their final <phrase>act</phrase> of revenge , the two start a <phrase>video</phrase> diary to explain their feelings and chronicle their mission . there is another similar <phrase>movie</phrase> like this , called <phrase>``</phrase> <phrase>elephant</phrase> . '' why do i bring this up ? to compare the two <phrase>films</phrase> , of course . i have to say , even though i liked <phrase>``</phrase> <phrase>elephant</phrase> , '' this is a much better <phrase>film</phrase> . what 's the difference , you ask ? well , for starters , this is <phrase>shot</phrase> differently , much along the lines of <phrase>``</phrase> <phrase>cloverfield</phrase> , '' <phrase>``</phrase> <phrase>blair</phrase> <phrase>witch</phrase> project , '' and <phrase>``</phrase> diary of the dead . '' this makes the <phrase>movie</phrase> all the better because it 's much more painfully realistic . but what won me over was how the <phrase>movie</phrase> was willing to show the <phrase>``</phrase> other side of the story . '' you get to know these two shooters , unlike <phrase>``</phrase> <phrase>elephant</phrase> . '' i actually cared for one of the shooters and could understand their actions and why they did what they did . this <phrase>movie</phrase> actually makes you feel sympathetic to these people and that 's a good thing because it 's not always <phrase>black</phrase> and <phrase>white</phrase> . to be honest , this is why i almost cried in this <phrase>movie</phrase> . the characters are real <phrase>human</phrase> beings with <phrase>logic</phrase> and reasons behind their actions . you get to understand them . it 's not like they want to kill people for attention . overall , this <phrase>film</phrase> is emotionally gripping and very haunting and much better than <phrase>``</phrase> <phrase>elephant</phrase> . ''
just imagine the real <phrase>hitler</phrase> , who was a <phrase>master</phrase> of <phrase>propaganda</phrase> and speech , would have been such a mumbling moron as <phrase>carlyle</phrase> portrayed him in this <phrase>film</phrase> . nobody would have followed him , not even a desperate , unemployed guy in the 1920s . this is just a <phrase>hollywood</phrase> cardboard piece of <phrase>propaganda</phrase> itself , disguised as <phrase>``</phrase> true <phrase>history</phrase> '' . i pity everyone who actually believed anything from this show . <phrase>carlyle</phrase> and the producers did n't get anything right with this . why was <phrase>hitler</phrase> able to win so many people , a whole <phrase>county</phrase> for his ideas if we was such a <phrase>sausage</phrase> ? why did people follow him to <phrase>death</phrase> ? by portraying him as such a loser they make their own <phrase>film</phrase> <phrase>totally unbelievable</phrase> . this <phrase>film</phrase> is a mixture of old <phrase>ww2</phrase> <phrase>propaganda</phrase> and <phrase>mtv</phrase> <phrase>urban</phrase> myths about one of the most important persons of the last century . imagine a <phrase>film</phrase> about <phrase>churchill</phrase> where the <phrase>director</phrase> only shows him as a drunkard for 90 mins . this <phrase>film</phrase> is a disgrace and i wonder how they could <phrase>talk</phrase> an <phrase>actor</phrase> like <phrase>carlyle</phrase> into this dreck .
an executive , very successful in his <phrase>professional</phrase> <phrase>life</phrase> but very unable in his familiar <phrase>life</phrase> , meets a boy with down syndrome , escaped from a residence . both characters feel very alone , and the apparently less intelligent one will show to the executive the beauty of the small things in <phrase>life</phrase> ... with this argument , the somehow amelie-like <phrase>atmosphere</phrase> and the sentimental <phrase>music</phrase> , i did n't expect but a moralistic disgusting <phrase>movie</phrase> . anyway , as there were some interesting scenes ( the boy is sometimes quite a violent guy ) , and the interpretation of both <phrase>actors</phrase> , daniel auteil and pasqal duquenne , was very good , i decided to go on watching the <phrase>movie</phrase> . the <phrase>french</phrase> cinema , in <phrase>general</phrase> , has the ability of showing something that seems quite much to <phrase>life</phrase> , opposed to the more stereotyped <phrase>american</phrase> cinema . but , because of that , it is much more disappointing to see after the absurd ending , with the impossible <phrase>death</phrase> of the boy , the charming tone , the happiness of the executive 's <phrase>family</phrase> , the cheap moral , the unbearable laughter of the daughters , the guy waving from <phrase>heaven</phrase> as <phrase>michael landon</phrase> ... really nasty , in my <phrase>humble opinion</phrase> .
how low can someone sink while trying to recapture an old glory ? st : hf will be glad to show you . if you are used to seeing what made for a good <phrase>star</phrase> trek show , do not <phrase>watch</phrase> this . the writing is hodge-podge , the <phrase>actors</phrase> ' portrayals of their characters weak , and most of all , the <phrase>design</phrase> work is downright doggy . like watching strong captains , do n't look here ! like the strong federation attitude ? forget about it here ! <phrase>starfleet</phrase> is mocked by ensigns wearing spikes in their <phrase>hair</phrase> . while a seemingly mentally feeble <phrase>captain</phrase> shuffles about and within two minutes of the opening show 's credits , <phrase>ensign</phrase> spikey is attempting to arrange a tryst with an <phrase>engineer</phrase> . it just degrades from there . no , not even uniforms match , for goodness <phrase>sake</phrase> . they are too small or too big , collars down to their chests , and <phrase>tng</phrase> seasons one and two uniforms mixed in with <phrase>season</phrase> three and ds9 uniforms . the strict discipline and tradition of any of the originals in lacking in this <phrase>production</phrase> down to the treads ! the only good thing about this show is its graphics , which seem to improve a <phrase>bit</phrase> with each <phrase>season</phrase> . <phrase>ok</phrase> , i take that back . who uses cg that inexpertly ? the designers of this show . do n't bother with it , it will offend your <phrase>star</phrase> trek sense , as it did mine . not even the throw <phrase>backs</phrase> to previous shows can save this catastrophe . i wept openly when i watched this , probably because my eyes were bleeding and my head almost ruptured . that bad .
this show seemed to be kinda good . <phrase>kyra sedgwick</phrase> is an <phrase>ok</phrase> <phrase>actress</phrase> and i like <phrase>police</phrase> series , but somewhere in the <phrase>production</phrase> this program went awfully wrong . first of all , the writers should have more suspects than one , you know who did it every time ! ! ! ! ! that makes it boring . the <phrase>main character</phrase> is unbelievably annoying and its not believable in any way . i know they wanted her to be tough , but shes mean , stupid and a bad chief . the crimes are uninteresting and bland , and its just lame all the way . as stated above , i hate it .... all in all , this was a big disappointment and very bad indeed ...
i just saw this <phrase>movie</phrase> tonight , <phrase>opening night</phrase> . it was great ! ! i 'm a big fan of <phrase>sports</phrase> movies , and this was right up there as one of my favorites . <phrase>dennis quaid</phrase> was great . ( oh , by the way , mr. quaid , if you read this ... my sister lives in <phrase>austin</phrase> , where you <phrase>live</phrase> ..... and she was supposed to buy you a drink once ... well ... she kinda stood you up ... but she did n't mean to ! : c ) [ not that anyone 's going to believe that ... ] ) anyway , it 's a great <phrase>movie</phrase> . everyone who likes a good <phrase>sports</phrase> <phrase>movie</phrase> , should go out and see it ! : c )
honestly , who in <phrase>god</phrase> 's name gave this <phrase>movie</phrase> an 8.1 rating ? ? i guess the people who actually made or starred in the <phrase>movie</phrase> were the ones who voted . otherwise this <phrase>movie</phrase> sucks ! this <phrase>movie</phrase> is nothing more than an <phrase>amateur</phrase> , or possibly <phrase>student</phrase> , <phrase>film</phrase> . i 'm a <phrase>movie</phrase> fanatic , and have seen terrible movies , but there was literally nothing redeeming here . the story and acting was the worst i 've ever seen . the props , including the use of <phrase>toy</phrase> <phrase>airsoft</phrase> guns with terrible <phrase>special effects</phrase> , where just as bad as everything else . i 'm all for bad <phrase>language</phrase> in movies , but the f-bomb was dropped about every third word and i think we might have a winner for the most use of the f-bomb in any <phrase>movie</phrase> ever . the <phrase>movie</phrase> also appears to have been filmed using cheap <phrase>video</phrase> cameras and not actual <phrase>film</phrase> . i 'd expect this to get awards for an <phrase>amateur</phrase> <phrase>movie</phrase> shown only on <phrase>public</phrase> access <phrase>stations</phrase> around the <phrase>country</phrase> , but it does n't belong on a <phrase>dvd</phrase> . do not buy this <phrase>movie</phrase> . do not rent this <phrase>movie</phrase> . all i can say was that this was a terrible waste of a <phrase>free</phrase> <phrase>movie</phrase> rental coupon . this is valuable time that you will never get back . unfortunately for me , that time is <phrase>lost</phrase> , but it 's not too late for you . if you decide to rent this <phrase>movie</phrase> , consider this my warning .
while the prices have gone up a lot , and some of the details have become dated , any homeowner who 's struggled with problems of homeownership should get a lot of <phrase>chuckles</phrase> out of this <phrase>movie</phrase> . i know i did . mr. <phrase>blandings</phrase> , a new <phrase>york</phrase> <phrase>ad</phrase> executive , decides to move his <phrase>family</phrase> to the <phrase>connecticut</phrase> suburbs and build himself a <phrase>nice</phrase> <phrase>house</phrase> there . he gets into one hilarious jam after another , from mortgages to lawsuits to <phrase>construction</phrase> difficulties , as the costs and schedule of the <phrase>construction</phrase> keep escalating out of control . i thought that the funniest scenes were where <phrase>blandings</phrase> hires a contractor to dig a well for <phrase>water</phrase> . they dig down hundreds of feet , but never find <phrase>water</phrase> . yet only a <phrase>short</phrase> distance away , a few days later , the basement of his <phrase>house</phrase>-to-be floods ! <phrase>cary grant</phrase> and <phrase>myrna loy</phrase> give believable performances as the harried <phrase>blandings</phrase> couple overwhelmed by problems they never imagined , and <phrase>melvyn douglas</phrase> is even better as blanding 's <phrase>lawyer</phrase> and <phrase>family</phrase> friend . the only caveat is that social attitudes have changed a lot since 1948 . mrs. <phrase>blandings</phrase> is portrayed as a <phrase>bit</phrase> of a naive dimbulb who has no idea how much additional trouble she 's causing , and there 's a <phrase>black</phrase> maid ( horrors ! ) . so do n't <phrase>watch</phrase> this <phrase>movie</phrase> through the social <phrase>lens</phrase> of 2003 , and you 'll enjoy it all the more .
worst <phrase>movie</phrase> ever ! ! ! ! ca n't believe i wasted 90min of my <phrase>life</phrase> watching this crap . the only reason i did n't turn it off was i wanted to see the <phrase>gangster</phrase> dude on the <phrase>cover</phrase> and he was n't even in it <phrase>talk</phrase> about <phrase>false advertising</phrase> . the people that gave this <phrase>movie</phrase> a ten are either dumb , stupid or <phrase>cast members</phrase> or <phrase>friends</phrase> of <phrase>cast members</phrase> . i gave it a solid 2 because no one else did i have to write more and i do n't even want to . wasting my time talking about this rubbish . please do n't <phrase>watch</phrase> it and if you did then vote so this <phrase>movie</phrase> can go where it belongs . bottom 100 movies . i ca n't even tell you how bad it really is . think the worst <phrase>movie</phrase> ever that you 've seen then times that be ten and thats this <phrase>movie</phrase> . it sucked ! ! if you just think i 'm being bitter then <phrase>watch</phrase> it i dare you ! ! this <phrase>movie</phrase> should be used to <phrase>torture</phrase> <phrase>war</phrase> criminals or terriosts . if they <phrase>watch</phrase> this even two times and they 'll be spilling the beans and begging for mercy ! !
awwww .... yes , it is heartwarming and all that some unlucky <phrase>family</phrase> gets adopted by <phrase>abc</phrase>/<phrase>sears</phrase> and has their home <phrase>``</phrase> renovated . '' that 's where the humanistic <phrase>appeal</phrase> ends . i liked it early in its run , but now this show has become disgustingly excessive . ten needy families could be given relatively luxurious homes with lots of <phrase>goodies</phrase> for every one <phrase>family</phrase> that each episode of this show splurges on . the people at <phrase>habitat</phrase> for humanity must be shaking their heads in disbelief . for example , is it necessary for a healthy sixteen year old boy to have a <phrase>jacuzzi</phrase> in his bedroom , or have his bed tricked-out with <phrase>``</phrase> <phrase>low rider</phrase> '' <phrase>hydraulics</phrase> ? does the mom really need her dilapidated , non-running and rusted out old pick-up <phrase>truck</phrase> restored and <phrase>``</phrase> pimped '' by some of the best customizers in <phrase>california</phrase> ? a new one would have done the job quite nicely , and probably for a third of the price . do people really need a sixty-five inch plasma screen in every room of the <phrase>house</phrase> ? and then there 's the issue of who pays the increased <phrase>property</phrase> taxes and utility <phrase>bills</phrase> . even after the zaniacs at <phrase>``</phrase> makeover '' leave , somebody still has earn a living . i doubt the <phrase>friendly</phrase> folks down at <phrase>social services</phrase> will see the humor in all of this largess . this show is nothing more than a ratings grabber for <phrase>abc</phrase> , and a tacit commercial for its sponsors .
while the story is sweet , and the dancing and <phrase>singing</phrase> in the main part of the <phrase>film</phrase> are a joy , the uniqueness of the <phrase>film</phrase> ( and what makes it a masterpiece ) is <phrase>the dream</phrase> <phrase>sequence</phrase> . it features the combination of the highest form of truly <phrase>american</phrase> <phrase>music</phrase> ( <phrase>gershwin</phrase> ) , the engaging beauty of <phrase>french</phrase> <phrase>impressionistic</phrase> <phrase>art</phrase> , kelly 's enthralling <phrase>choreography</phrase> ( including his rapturous <phrase>``</phrase> pas de deux d'amour '' , really a separate <phrase>genre</phrase> ) , with the most magnificent palette of color ever devised for the set . matching the surging <phrase>music</phrase> and the visual explosion with those dances was a true work of a creative genius and a great <phrase>artist</phrase> .
-kidnappings in <phrase>mexico</phrase> are as common as honeys giving me their phone numbers so if you 're rich then you 'll need a good <phrase>bodyguard</phrase> to keep you and your kids safe . a couple hires a washed up <phrase>bodyguard</phrase> called creasy to protect their adorable kid <phrase>pita</phrase> . at first , their relationship is a tad buggy but after a while , creasy eases up to the girl and the two develop a father/daughter relationship . one day <phrase>pita</phrase> is kidnapped and creasy is badly injured in the process . when he wakes up he finds out that the girl has been killed due to a <phrase>ransom</phrase> negotiations that went wrong and this sets creasy on a path find the men responsible for her <phrase>death</phrase> and make sure they are brought to his <phrase>brand</phrase> of <phrase>justice</phrase> . -keep some tylenol next to you while watching this <phrase>movie</phrase> because you will need to take some after watching it . i really <phrase>love</phrase> the story here of going to the extreme to obtain revenge because most movies usually just want revenge but really never go too far where as this <phrase>movie</phrase> they show how far a man can go to do what he feels is right . the only problem is the annoying <phrase>visual style</phrase> , which will either make you hate the <phrase>movie</phrase> or hate <phrase>tony scott</phrase> . i really feel sorry for the <phrase>cinematographer</phrase> because i 'm sure he came into this <phrase>movie</phrase> thinking he was going to be filming an <phrase>action</phrase> <phrase>movie</phrase> and probably got all excited but instead he got stuck being the dp for a <phrase>filmmaker</phrase> that feels that the whole <phrase>movie</phrase> should look like it 's been possessed by <phrase>demons</phrase> . i would n't have mind if the crappy visuals were restricted to a few <phrase>action</phrase> scenes but when it 's spread through out the whole <phrase>movie</phrase> then that 's when we have some problems . the same annoying style was recently used on <phrase>``</phrase> domino '' and much like with this <phrase>movie</phrase> the style did hurt that otherwise great <phrase>movie</phrase> . -another person i feel sorry on this <phrase>movie</phrase> was the soon to be great <phrase>harry gregson williams</phrase> who had the impossible task of trying to <phrase>compose</phrase> <phrase>music</phrase> out of the jagged images . somehow , <phrase>williams</phrase> wrote some decent <phrase>music</phrase> for the <phrase>movie</phrase> but i 'm sure if the <phrase>movie</phrase> had been more stable then the <phrase>music</phrase> would have turned out a lot better . the <phrase>sound</phrase> is wrongfully used throughout the <phrase>movie</phrase> and instead of enhancing the <phrase>movie</phrase> experience , it rather makes you feel like you 're being punished . the overuse of the <phrase>subwoofer</phrase> is irritating as every 5 seconds or so you can hear an ungodly low end <phrase>sound</phrase> coming out of it . i do n't know why scott thought the audience needed to be bombarded by the <phrase>subwoofer</phrase> but it really takes you away from the <phrase>movie</phrase> . -the acting in the <phrase>movie</phrase> is a beast despite the visuals . little fanning does yet another great job here and the scene at the end of the <phrase>movie</phrase> just breaks my <phrase>heart</phrase> . if the end of the <phrase>movie</phrase> does n't make anyone cry then they 're dead on the inside . <phrase>denzel washington</phrase> breaks his rule of not making any <phrase>action</phrase> movies with this <phrase>movie</phrase> and luckily , for him he gets to <phrase>play</phrase> a great character . the whole idea of a man that 's <phrase>lost</phrase> in <phrase>life</phrase> and all of a sudden due to a <phrase>tragedy</phrase> finds a purpose in his <phrase>life</phrase> is nothing new but <phrase>washington</phrase> brings some <phrase>heart</phrase> and <phrase>emotion</phrase> to the otherwise flat character . i <phrase>love</phrase> how we witness him from being a loner to actually learning to have <phrase>emotion</phrase> and after the <phrase>kidnapping</phrase> becoming a cold instrument of revenge . <phrase>radha mitchell</phrase> plays <phrase>marc anthony</phrase> 's wife and she along with fanning are the two reasons why i ca n't hate the <phrase>movie</phrase> too much . <phrase>j.lo</phrase> 's husband comes and goes in the <phrase>movie</phrase> but he does n't really stand out much . <phrase>mickey</phrase> rourke and chris walken all have minimal roles in the <phrase>movie</phrase> but they do make an impact . -one thing that makes me laugh is how the filmmakers try to makeup for the crappy way they portray <phrase>mexico</phrase> by calling it a fine <phrase>city</phrase> at the end of the <phrase>movie</phrase> . a little too late for that if you ask me . let 's hope that <phrase>tony scott</phrase> is done with this phase of intentionally trying to ruin his career because a <phrase>filmmaker</phrase> as talented as him can and must do better than this .
first a technical review . the script is so slow , it is really a 25 minute story blown up to 1 hour 40 min . the dialogue is so flat and truly one-dimensional . the <phrase>``</phrase> acting '' is pathetic , they seem to really have lifted schoolchildren out of class to read a few lines from an idiot board . as for the whole <phrase>``</phrase> point '' of the story , namely <phrase>``</phrase> <phrase>war</phrase> is bad '' ( oh , there 's a shock ! ) is really non-existent . without out the <phrase>``</phrase> lets shock 'em and get great publicity '' scene nobody would be talking about this <phrase>film</phrase> . it is so bad it actually bothers me to think what better things the <phrase>money</phrase> used this could have gone on . believe me i 've seen some bad <phrase>``</phrase> <phrase>emperor</phrase> 's new clothes '' <phrase>films</phrase> but the one thing i can say for them is at least they were well <phrase>shot</phrase> and well made while the <phrase>camera</phrase> wobbled during two scenes in this ! read all the other reviews - avoid at all costs and do n't <phrase>talk</phrase> about it .
